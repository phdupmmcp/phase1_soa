AB Context. Efficiently tracking Advance Care Planning (ACP) documentation
   in electronic heath records (EHRs) is essential for quality improvement
   and research efforts. The use of large language models (LLMs) offers a
   novel approach to this task. Objectives. To evaluate the ability of LLMs
   to identify ACP in EHRs for patients with advanced cancer and compare
   performance to gold-standard manual chart review and natural language
   processing (NLP). Methods. EHRs from patients with advanced cancer
   followed at seven Dana Farber Cancer Center (DFCI) clinics in June 2024.
   We utilized GPT-4o-2024-05-13 within DFCI's HIPAA-secure digital
   infrastructure. We designed LLM prompts to identify ACP domains: goals
   of care, limitation of life-sustaining treatment, hospice, and
   palliative care. We developed a novel hallucination index to measure
   production of factually-incorrect evidence by the LLM. Performance was
   compared to gold-standard manual chart review and NLP. Results. 60
   unique patients associated with 528 notes were used to construct the
   gold-standard data set. LLM prompts had sensitivity ranging from 0.85 to
   1.0, specificity ranging from 0.80 to 0.91, and accuracy ranging from
   0.81 to 0.91 across domains. The LLM had better sensitivity than NLP for
   identifying complex topics such as goals of care. Average hallucination
   index for notes identified by LLM was less than 0.5, indicating a low
   probability of hallucination. Despite lower precision compared to NLP,
   false positive documentation identified by LLMs was clinically-relevant
   and useful for guiding management. Conclusion. LLMs can capture ACP
   domains from EHRs, with sensitivity exceeding NLP methods for complex
   domains such as goals of care. Future studies should explore approaches
   for scaling this methodology. J Pain Symptom Manage 2025;69:243-250. (c)

AB PURPOSE: The purpose of our study was to (1) use a large language model
   (LLM) to identify goals-of-care (GOC) conversations in a large volume of
   notes, and (2) explore the potential of LLMs for a novel summarization
   task.
   METHODS: We included patients diagnosed with advanced cancer between
   April 1, 2024, and June 30, 2024. A validated LLM prompt for GOC was
   applied to electronic health records (EHRs) using a Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)-secure version of GPT-4o, a
   LLM developed by OpenAI. Output included (1) presence or absence of GOC
   documentation, (2) explanations with source text used to inform the
   LLM's determination, and (3) a hallucination score, indicating
   proportion of source text generated by the LLM that did not perfectly
   match text in the EHR. Two LLM prompts were designed to generate
   structured and unstructured GOC summaries. We randomly selected five
   patients and applied the summarization task to notes flagged by LLM as
   containing GOC. We reviewed LLM summaries to examine for relevant
   information.
   RESULTS: Among 326 patients associated with nearly 1,400 clinical notes,
   LLM flagged approximately 40% of notes for GOC documentation. Subsequent
   review of explanation text identified that 128 patients (nearly 40% of
   the total patient population) had GOC documentation. The hallucination
   index for explanations was low, suggesting that the LLM did not produce
   text that was not found in EHRs. LLM prompts produced accurate summaries
   in less than 2 minutes per patient.
   CONCLUSION: LLMs can capture GOC at scale and generate clinically useful
   summaries. Future directions include real-time implementation in the
   clinical setting.

AB The expectations for artificial intelligence (AI) technology have
   increased considerably in recent years, mainly due to the emergence of
   deep learning. At present, AI technology is being used for various
   purposes and has brought about change in society. In particular, the
   rapid development of generative AI technology, exemplified by ChatGPT,
   has amplified the societal impact of AI. The medical field is no
   exception, with a wide range of AI technologies being introduced for
   basic and applied research. Further, AI-equipped software as a medical
   device (AI-SaMD) is also being approved by regulatory bodies. Combined
   with the advent of big data, data-driven research utilizing AI is
   actively pursued. Nevertheless, while AI technology has great potential,
   it also presents many challenges that require careful consideration. In
   this review, we introduce the current status of AI-based cancer
   research, especially from the perspective of clinical application, and
   discuss the associated challenges and future directions, with the aim of
   helping to promote cancer research that utilizes effective AI
   technology.

AB Objective. Radiotherapy planning requires significant expertise to
   balance tumor control and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. Automated
   planning can improve both efficiency and quality. This study introduces
   GPT-Plan, a novel multi-agent system powered by the GPT-4 family of
   large language models (LLMs), for automating the iterative radiotherapy
   plan optimization. Approach. GPT-Plan uses LLM-driven agents, mimicking
   the collaborative clinical workflow of a dosimetrist and physicist, to
   iteratively generate and evaluate text-based radiotherapy plans based on
   predefined criteria. Supporting tools assist the agents by leveraging
   historical plans, mitigating LLM hallucinations, and balancing
   exploration and exploitation. Performance was evaluated on 12 lung
   (IMRT) and 5 cervical (VMAT) cancer cases, benchmarked against the ECHO
   auto-planning method and manual plans. The impact of historical plan
   retrieval on efficiency was also assessed. Results. For IMRT lung cancer
   cases, GPT-Plan generated high-quality plans, demonstrating superior
   target coverage and homogeneity compared to ECHO while maintaining
   comparable or better OAR sparing. For VMAT cervical cancer cases, plan
   quality was comparable to a senior physicist and consistently superior
   to a junior physicist, particularly for OAR sparing. Retrieving
   historical plans significantly reduced the number of required
   optimization iterations for lung cases (p < 0.01) and yielded iteration
   counts comparable to those of the senior physicist for cervical cases (p
   = 0.313). Occasional LLM hallucinations have been mitigated by
   self-reflection mechanisms. One limitation was the inaccuracy of
   vision-based LLMs in interpreting dose images. Significance. This
   pioneering study demonstrates the feasibility of automating radiotherapy
   planning using LLM-powered agents for complex treatment decision-making
   tasks. While challenges remain in addressing LLM limitations, ongoing
   advancements hold potential for further refining and expanding
   GPT-Plan's capabilities.

AB Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of RadOnc-generative pretrained
   transformer (GPT), a GPT-4 based large language model, in assisting with
   in-basket message response generation for prostate cancer treatment,
   with the goal of reducing the workload and time on clinical care teams
   while maintaining response quality.
   Patients and Methods: RadOnc-GPT was integrated with electronic health
   records from both Mayo Clinic-wide databases and a
   radiation-oncology-specific database. The model was evaluated on 158
   previously recorded in-basket message interactions, selected from 90
   patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from the Mayo Clinic
   Department of Radiation Oncology in-basket message database in the
   calendar years 2022-2024. Quantitative natural language processing
   analysis and 2 grading studies, conducted by 5 clinicians and 4 nurses,
   were used to assess RadOnc-GPT's responses. Three primary clinicians
   independently graded all messages, whereas a fourth senior clinician
   reviewed 41 responses with relevant discrepancies, and a fifth senior
   clinician evaluated 2 additional responses. The grading focused on 5 key
   areas: completeness, correctness, clarity, empathy, and editing time.
   The grading study was performed from July 20, 2024 to December 15, 2024.
   Results: The RadOnc-GPT slightly outperformed the clinical care team in
   empathy, whereas achieving comparable scores with the clinical care team
   in completeness, correctness, and clarity. Five clinician graders
   identified key limitations in RadOnc-GPT's responses, such as lack of
   context, insufficient domain-specific knowledge, inability to perform
   essential meta-tasks, and hallucination. It was estimated that
   RadOnc-GPT could save an average of 5.2 minutes per message for nurses
   and 2.4 minutes for clinicians, from reading the inquiry to sending the
   response.
   Conclusion: RadOnc-GPT has the potential to considerably reduce the
   workload of clinical care teams by generating high-quality, timely
   responses for in-basket message interactions. This could lead to
   improved efficiency in health care workflows and reduced costs while
   maintaining or enhancing the quality of communication between patients
   and health care providers.Abbreviations and AcronymsAI; artificial

AB Background: Dietary supplements (DSs) are widely used to improve health
   and nutrition, but challenges related to misinformation, safety, and
   efficacy persist dueto less stringent regulations compared with
   pharmaceuticals. Accurate and reliable DS information is critical for
   both consumers and health care providers to make informed decisions.
   Objective: This study aimed to enhance DS-related question answering by
   integrating an advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system with
   the integrated Dietary Supplement Knowledgebase 2.0 (iDISK2.0), a
   dietary supplement knowledge base, to improve accuracy and reliability.
   Methods: We developed iDISK2.0 by integrating updated data from
   authoritative sources, including the Natural Medicines Comprehensive
   Database, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center database, Dietary
   Supplement Label Database, and Licensed Natural Health Products
   Database, and applied advanced data cleaning and standardization
   techniques to reduce noise. The RAG system combined the retrieval power
   of a biomedical knowledge graph with the generative capabilities of
   large language models (LLMs) to address limitations of stand-alone LLMs,
   such as hallucination. The system retrieves contextually relevant
   subgraphs from iDISK2.0 based on user queries, enabling accurate and
   evidence-based responses through a user-friendly interface. We evaluated
   the system using true-or-false and multiple-choice questions derived
   from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center database and compared
   its performance with stand-alone LLMs. Results: iDISK2.0 integrates
   174,317 entitiesacross 7 categories, including 8091 dietary supplement
   ingredients; 163,806 dietary supplement products; 786 diseases; and 625
   drugs, along with 6 types of relationships. The RAG system achieved an
   accuracy of 99% (990/1000) for true-or-false questions on DS
   effectiveness and 95% (948/100) for multiple-choice questions on DS-drug
   interactions, substantially outperforming stand-alone LLMs like GPT-4o
   (OpenAI), which scored 62% (618/1000) and 52% (517/1000) on these
   respective tasks. The user interface enabled efficient interaction,
   supporting free-form text input and providing accurate responses.
   Integration strategies minimized data noise, ensuring access to
   up-to-date, DS-related information. Conclusions:By integrating a robust
   knowledge graph with RAG and LLM technologies, iDISK2.0 addresses the
   critical limitations of stand-alone LLMs in DS information retrieval.
   This study highlights the importance of combining structured data with
   advanced artificial intelligence methods to improve accuracy and reduce
   misinformation in health care applications. Future work includes
   extending the framework to broader biomedical domains and improving
   evaluation with real-world, open-ended queries.
