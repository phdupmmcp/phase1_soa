AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) has impacted global economy, workforce
   productivity, smart health, smart cities, smart transport, and much more
   to come. Large Language Models (LLM) such as ChatGPT and Google's
   Gemini, have been widely adopted in various applications. Blockchain
   Technology stands as a towering disruptor in today's tech landscape,
   offering assurances of enhanced security and scalability for various
   applications. Within the realm of healthcare, its adoption has surged,
   spanning from streamlined recordkeeping to bolstered clinical trials,
   fortified medical supply chains, and vigilant patient monitoring. These
   applications harness the intrinsic attributes of blockchain to elevate
   standards of safety, privacy, and security within the healthcare sector.
   The combined power of AI and blockchain has the potential to
   revolutionize healthcare delivery, ensuring improved security,
   transparency, and efficiency. Nevertheless, Porru et al. [1] have
   highlighted deficiencies in the processes, tools, and techniques within
   this domain. Hence, this paper aims to furnish a structured framework
   that ensures both security and sustainability in the development of
   healthcare blockchain applications. This paper also provides an overview
   of societal impact on both technologies. This article has evolved best
   practice guidelines and a systematic development framework for
   AI-Blockchain integration, known as AI-BlockchainOps. This research has
   also developed a reference architecture, exemplifying the modeling of an
   Electronic Health Record (EHR) using BPMN and simulation. Within this
   Electronic Health Record (EHR) scenario encompassing 100 user requests,
   the simulation absorbed 97.09% of cloud resources, with 76.33% allocated
   to knowledge discovery, and a utilization rate of 93.20% for blockchain
   scientists, alongside various other contributing factors.

AB The rapid development of specific-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs),
   such as Med-PaLM, MEDITRON-70B, and Med-Gemini, has significantly
   impacted healthcare, offering unprecedented capabilities in clinical
   decision support, diagnostics, and personalized health monitoring. This
   paper reviews the advancements in medicine-specific LLMs, the
   integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and prompt
   engineering, and their applications in improving diagnostic accuracy and
   educational utility. Despite the potential, these technologies present
   challenges, including bias, hallucinations, and the need for robust
   safety protocols. The paper also discusses the regulatory and ethical
   considerations necessary for integrating these models into mainstream
   healthcare. By examining current studies and developments, this paper
   aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of LLMs in
   medicine and highlight the future directions for research and
   application. The study concludes that while LLMs hold immense potential,
   their safe and effective integration into clinical practice requires
   rigorous testing, ongoing evaluation, and continuous collaboration among
   stakeholders.

AB The global aged population is expected to exceed 2.1 billion,
   representing 21.65% of the total population by 2050. This demographic
   shift underscores an urgent need for efficient elderly care,
   particularly in home settings. AI advancements have made sensor
   technology, including wearable biosensors, environmental monitors, and
   biochemical sensors, essential for elderly care by enabling the
   collection of physiological and activity data. Current systems overwhelm
   caregivers with complex data analysis and personalized recommendations.
   Large language models (LLMs) address this by offering insights through
   natural language interfaces, using extensive medical data. While some
   studies have integrated sensor data with LLMs for health monitoring
   applications, a comprehensive framework for seamlessly combining diverse
   sensor data with LLMs in elderly care is still missing. In this study,
   we propose a novel methodological framework that addresses the
   challenges of integrating heterogeneous sensor data with LLMs to provide
   real-time healthcare insights for caregivers of the elderly using sensor
   technologies. Our framework employs few-shot learning on Generative
   Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-4) and GPT3.5 to process structured sensor
   data from wearable and environmental devices. The LLMpowered application
   then generates insightful responses based on the user's input, providing
   actionable and personalized recommendations. The GPT-4 model
   outperformed GPT-3.5 in Structured Query Language (SQL) query generation
   for sensor data retrieval and processing, achieving a semantic
   similarity score of 0.95, precision of 88.5%, recall of 98.92%, and an
   F1-score of 93.40%. In this study, we explore how integrating sensor
   data with LLMs enhances usability and reduces complexity in health
   monitoring systems. Our framework sets a new benchmark for advancing
   elderly care through innovative LLM-powered applications and sensor
   technology.

AB Deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses neural
   networks with multiple layers, is rapidly changing healthcare. Its
   ability to analyze large datasets and extract relevant information makes
   it a powerful tool for improving diagnosis, treatment, and disease
   management. The integration of DL with pressure mats-which are devices
   that use pressure sensors to continuously and non-invasively monitor the
   interaction between patients and the contact surface-is a promising
   application. These pressure platforms generate data that can be very
   useful for detecting postural anomalies. In this paper we will discuss
   the application of deep learning algorithms in the analysis of pressure
   data for the detection of postural asymmetries in 139 patients aged 3 to
   20 years. We investigated several main tasks: patient classification,
   hemibody segmentation, recognition of specific body parts, and
   generation of automated clinical reports. For this purpose,
   convolutional neural networks in their classification and regression
   modalities, the object detection algorithm YOLOv8, and the open language
   model LLaMa3 were used. Our results demonstrated high accuracy in all
   tasks: classification achieved 100% accuracy; hemibody division obtained
   an MAE of approximately 7; and object detection had an average accuracy
   of 70%. These results demonstrate the potential of this approach for
   monitoring postural and motor disabilities. By enabling personalized
   patient care, our methodology contributes to improved clinical outcomes
   and healthcare delivery. To our best knowledge, this is the first study
   that combines pressure images with multiple deep learning algorithms for
   the detection and assessment of postural disorders and motor
   disabilities in this group of patients.

AB Artificial intelligence can detect suicidal ideation manifestations in
   texts. Studies demonstrate that BERT-based models achieve better
   performance in text classification problems. Large language models
   (LLMs) answer free-text queries without being specifically trained. This
   work aims to compare the performance of three variations of BERT models
   and LLMs (Google Bard, Microsoft Bing/GPT-4, and OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5) for
   identifying suicidal ideation from nonclinical texts written in
   Brazilian Portuguese. A dataset labeled by psychologists consisted of
   2,691 sentences without suicidal ideation and 1,097 with suicidal
   ideation, of which 100 sentences were selected for testing. We applied
   data preprocessing techniques, hyperparameter optimization, and hold-out
   cross-validation for training and testing BERT models. When evaluating
   LLMs, we used zero-shot prompting engineering. Each test sentence was
   labeled if it contained suicidal ideation, according to the chatbot's
   response. Bing/GPT-4 achieved the best performance, with 98% across all
   metrics. Fine-tuned BERT models outperformed the other LLMs:
   BERTimbau-Large performed the best with a 96% accuracy, followed by
   BERTimbau-Base with 94%, and BERT-Multilingual with 87%. Bard performed
   the worst with 62% accuracy, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 achieved 81%. The high
   recall capacity of the models suggests a low misclassification rate of
   at-risk patients, which is crucial to prevent missed interventions by
   professionals. However, despite their potential in supporting suicidal
   ideation detection, these models have not been validated in a patient
   monitoring clinical setting. Therefore, caution is advised when using
   the evaluated models as tools to assist healthcare professionals in
   detecting suicidal ideation.
