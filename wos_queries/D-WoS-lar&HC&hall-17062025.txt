AB The emergence of LLMs, like ChatGPT and Gemini, has marked the modern
   era of artificial intelligence applications characterized by high-impact
   applications generating text, images, and videos. However, these models
   usually ensue with one critical challenge called hallucination:
   confident presentation of inaccurate or fabricated information. This
   problem attracts serious concern when these models are applied to
   specialized domains, including healthcare and law, where the accuracy
   and preciseness of information are absolute conditions. In this paper,
   we propose EvoLLMs, an innovative framework inspired by Evolutionary
   Computation, which automates the generation of high-quality
   Question-answering (QA) datasets while minimizing hallucinations.
   EvoLLMs employs genetic algorithms, mimicking evolutionary processes
   like selection, variation, and mutation, to guide LLMs in generating
   accurate, contextually relevant question-answer pairs. Comparative
   analysis shows that EvoLLMs consistently outperforms human-generated
   datasets in key metrics such as Depth, Relevance, and Coverage, while
   nearly matching human performance in mitigating hallucinations. These
   results highlight EvoLLMs as a robust and efficient solution for QA
   dataset generation, significantly reducing the time and resources
   required for manual curation.

AB Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have emerged as potential
   game-changers in nursing, aiding in patient education, diagnostic
   assistance, treatment recommendations, and administrative task
   efficiency. While these advancements signal promising strides in
   healthcare, integrated LLMs are not without challenges, particularly
   artificial intelligence hallucination and data privacy concerns.
   Methodologies such as prompt engineering, temperature adjustments, model
   fine-tuning, and local deployment are proposed to refine the accuracy of
   LLMs and ensure data security. While LLMs offer transformative
   potential, it is imperative to acknowledge that they cannot substitute
   the intricate expertise of human professionals in the clinical field,
   advocating for a synergistic approach in patient care.

AB Large language model (LLM) is an important direction in the development
   of AGI, but its technology is still in rapid change, and its
   capabilities still have obvious deficiencies and imbalances, with
   persistent problems such as hallucination, value non-alignment, weak
   specialization, and black-box effect. In this case, how to apply LLM to
   different professional fields and develop high-quality AIGC industry
   applications has become a great challenge for ISVs. Building AIGC
   industry applications based on LLM is not simply a matter of functional
   realization. Although researchers and open-source communities have
   proposed numerous application development frameworks or tool components,
   there is a lack of overall architecture design for systems engineering
   and a lack of discussion on theories and methods of LLM application
   development in large-scale industry domains, such as healthcare,
   government affairs, finance, and media. This paper analyzes the basic
   ideas of LLM industry applications development, defines the functional
   requirements and feature requirements of LLM industry applications, puts
   forward the concept of Large Language Model Systems Engineering
   (LLM-SE), and develops an AI assisted clinical risk prediction system
   for amyloidosis disease based on the architecture of LLM-SE, which adopt
   knowledge engineering, quality engineering, etc., and verifies the
   LLM-SE development architecture and methodology.

AB Chatbots have become increasingly popular by transforming interactions
   across numerous fields. As the technology behind chatbots has rapidly
   developed, new methodologies have arisen, each contributing unique
   strengths and addressing different challenges. This paper systematically
   reviews the methods used in chatbot development from 2019 to 2024,
   comprehensively analyzing the studies. We categorize the techniques into
   three main groups: machine learning (ML)-based, deep learning
   (DL)-based, and large language model (LLM)-based methods. We present a
   broad and inclusive survey by exploring the foundational principles of
   chatbot technologies and their applications across diverse domains such
   as education, healthcare, and interviews. Our analysis reveals that
   while traditional ML-based methods remain widely used, DL models are
   gaining prominence for handling complex tasks, and LLM-based systems are
   advancing the field by offering more coherent, contextually aware
   responses. However, challenges remain, especially in ethical concerns
   like hallucination and privacy-preserving technologies, particularly
   with LLMs. The paper also identifies gaps in existing research, notably
   the need for improved privacy-preserving mechanisms and better
   strategies for mitigating hallucinations in chatbot responses. Future
   research directions are suggested to address these challenges,
   particularly in developing LLM-based chatbots, with a focus on enhancing
   privacy, accuracy, and ethical standards.

AB Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance the
   verification of health claims. However, issues with hallucination and
   comprehension of logical statements require these models to be closely
   scrutinized in healthcare applications. We introduce CliniFact, a
   scientific claim dataset created from hypothesis testing results in
   clinical research, covering 992 unique interventions for 22 disease
   categories. The dataset used study arms and interventions, primary
   outcome measures, and results from clinical trials to derive and label
   clinical research claims. These claims were then linked to supporting
   information describing clinical trial results in scientific
   publications. CliniFact contains 1,970 instances from 992 unique
   clinical trials related to 1,540 unique publications. When evaluating
   LLMs against CliniFact, discriminative models, such as BioBERT with an
   accuracy of 80.2%, outperformed generative counterparts, such as
   Llama3-70B, which reached 53.6% accuracy (p-value < 0.001). Our results
   demonstrate the potential of CliniFact as a benchmark for evaluating LLM
   performance in clinical research claim verification.

AB ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based conversational large
   language model (LLM). The potential applications of LLMs in health care
   education, research, and practice could be promising if the associated
   valid concerns are proactively examined and addressed. The current
   systematic review aimed to investigate the utility of ChatGPT in health
   care education, research, and practice and to highlight its potential
   limitations. Using the PRIMSA guidelines, a systematic search was
   conducted to retrieve English records in PubMed/MEDLINE and Google
   Scholar (published research or preprints) that examined ChatGPT in the
   context of health care education, research, or practice. A total of 60
   records were eligible for inclusion. Benefits of ChatGPT were cited in
   51/60 (85.0%) records and included: (1) improved scientific writing and
   enhancing research equity and versatility; (2) utility in health care
   research (efficient analysis of datasets, code generation, literature
   reviews, saving time to focus on experimental design, and drug discovery
   and development); (3) benefits in health care practice (streamlining the
   workflow, cost saving, documentation, personalized medicine, and
   improved health literacy); and (4) benefits in health care education
   including improved personalized learning and the focus on critical
   thinking and problem-based learning. Concerns regarding ChatGPT use were
   stated in 58/60 (96.7%) records including ethical, copyright,
   transparency, and legal issues, the risk of bias, plagiarism, lack of
   originality, inaccurate content with risk of hallucination, limited
   knowledge, incorrect citations, cybersecurity issues, and risk of
   infodemics. The promising applications of ChatGPT can induce paradigm
   shifts in health care education, research, and practice. However, the
   embrace of this AI chatbot should be conducted with extreme caution
   considering its potential limitations. As it currently stands, ChatGPT
   does not qualify to be listed as an author in scientific articles unless
   the ICMJE/COPE guidelines are revised or amended. An initiative
   involving all stakeholders in health care education, research, and
   practice is urgently needed. This will help to set a code of ethics to
   guide the responsible use of ChatGPT among other LLMs in health care and
   academia.

AB Objective. Liver cancer has a high incidence rate, but experienced
   doctors are lacking in primary healthcare settings. The development of
   large models offers new possibilities for diagnosis. However, in liver
   cancer diagnosis, large models face certain limitations, such as
   insufficient understanding of specific medical images, inadequate
   consideration of liver vessel factors, and inaccuracies in reasoning
   logic. Therefore, this study proposes a diagnostic assistance tool
   specific to liver cancer to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of
   primary care doctors. Approach. A liver cancer diagnosis framework
   combining large and small models is proposed. A more accurate model for
   liver tumor segmentation and a more precise model for liver vessel
   segmentation are developed. The features extracted from the segmentation
   results of the small models are combined with the patient's medical
   records and then provided to the large model. The large model employs
   chain of thought prompts to simulate expert diagnostic reasoning and
   uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide reliable answers based on
   trusted medical knowledge and cases. Main results. In the small model
   part, the proposed liver tumor and liver vessel segmentation methods
   achieve improved performance. In the large model part, this approach
   receives higher evaluation scores from doctors when analyzing patient
   imaging and medical records. Significance. First, a diagnostic framework
   combining small models and large models is proposed to optimize the
   liver cancer diagnosis process. Second, two segmentation models are
   introduced to compensate for the large model's shortcomings in
   extracting semantic information from images. Third, by simulating
   doctors' reasoning and integrating trusted knowledge, the framework
   enhances the reliability and interpretability of the large model's
   responses while reducing hallucination phenomena.

AB Background: Medication review and reconciliation is essential for
   optimizing drug therapy and minimizing medication errors. Large language
   models (LLMs) have been recently shown to possess a lot of potential
   applications in healthcare field due to their abilities of deductive,
   abductive, and logical reasoning. The present study assessed the
   abilities of LLMs in medication review and medication reconciliation
   processes. Methods: Four LLMs were prompted with appropriate queries
   related to dosing regimen errors, drug-drug interactions, therapeutic
   drug monitoring, and genomics-based decision-making process. The
   veracity of the LLM outputs were verified from validated sources using
   pre-validated criteria (accuracy, relevancy, risk management,
   hallucination mitigation, and citations and guidelines). The impacts of
   the erroneous responses on the patients' safety were categorized either
   as major or minor. Results: In the assessment of four LLMs regarding
   dosing regimen errors, drug-drug interactions, and suggestions for
   dosing regimen adjustments based on therapeutic drug monitoring and
   genomics-based individualization of drug therapy, responses were
   generally consistent across prompts with no clear pattern in response
   quality among the LLMs. For identification of dosage regimen errors,
   ChatGPT performed well overall, except for the query related to
   simvastatin. In terms of potential drug-drug interactions, all LLMs
   recognized interactions with warfarin but missed the interaction between
   metoprolol and verapamil. Regarding dosage modifications based on
   therapeutic drug monitoring, Claude-Instant provided appropriate
   suggestions for two scenarios and nearly appropriate suggestions for the
   other two. Similarly, for genomics-based decision-making, Claude-Instant
   offered satisfactory responses for four scenarios, followed by Gemini
   for three. Notably, Gemini stood out by providing references to
   guidelines or citations even without prompting, demonstrating a
   commitment to accuracy and reliability in its responses. Minor impacts
   were noted in identifying appropriate dosing regimens and therapeutic
   drug monitoring, while major impacts were found in identifying drug
   interactions and making pharmacogenomic-based therapeutic decisions.
   Conclusion: Advanced LLMs hold significant promise in revolutionizing
   the medication review and reconciliation process in healthcare. Diverse
   impacts on patient safety were observed. Integrating and validating LLMs
   within electronic health records and prescription systems is essential
   to harness their full potential and enhance patient safety and care
   quality.
