AB Background: Logic Learning Machine (LLM) is an innovative method of
   supervised analysis capable of constructing models based on simple and
   intelligible rules.
   In this investigation the performance of LLM in classifying patients
   with cancer was evaluated using a set of eight publicly available gene
   expression databases for cancer diagnosis.
   LLM accuracy was assessed by summary ROC curve (sROC) analysis and
   estimated by the area under an sROC curve (sAUC). Its performance was
   compared in cross validation with that of standard supervised methods,
   namely: decision tree, artificial neural network, support vector machine
   (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor classifier.
   Results: LLM showed an excellent accuracy (sAUC = 0.99, 95%CI: 0.98-1.0)
   and outperformed any other method except SVM.
   Conclusions: LLM is a new powerful tool for the analysis of gene
   expression data for cancer diagnosis. Simple rules generated by LLM
   could contribute to a better understanding of cancer biology,
   potentially addressing therapeutic approaches.

AB PurposeIn radiology, large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT,
   have recently gained attention, and their utility is being rapidly
   evaluated. However, concerns have emerged regarding their reliability in
   clinical applications due to limitations such as hallucinations and
   insufficient referencing. To address these issues, we focus on the
   latest technology, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which enables
   LLMs to reference reliable external knowledge (REK). Specifically, this
   study examines the utility and reliability of a recently released
   RAG-equipped LLM (RAG-LLM), NotebookLM, for staging lung
   cancer.Materials and methodsWe summarized the current lung cancer
   staging guideline in Japan and provided this as REK to NotebookLM. We
   then tasked NotebookLM with staging 100 fictional lung cancer cases
   based on CT findings and evaluated its accuracy. For comparison, we
   performed the same task using a gold-standard LLM, GPT-4 Omni (GPT-4o),
   both with and without the REK. For GPT-4o, the REK was provided directly
   within the prompt rather than through RAG.ResultsNotebookLM achieved 86%
   diagnostic accuracy in the lung cancer staging experiment, outperforming
   GPT-4o, which recorded 39% accuracy with the REK and 25% without it.
   Moreover, NotebookLM demonstrated 95% accuracy in searching reference
   locations within the REK.ConclusionNotebookLM, a RAG-LLM, successfully
   performed lung cancer staging by utilizing the REK, demonstrating
   superior performance compared to GPT-4o (without RAG). Additionally, it
   provided highly accurate reference locations within the REK, allowing
   radiologists to efficiently evaluate the reliability of NotebookLM's
   responses and detect possible hallucinations. Overall, this study
   highlights the potential of NotebookLM, a RAG-LLM, in image diagnosis.

AB Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancers in female
   populations. The exact cause is not known, but is most likely to be a
   combination of genetic and environmental factors. Log-logistic model
   (LLM) is applied as a statistical method for predicting survival and it
   influencing factors. In recent decades, artificial neural network (ANN)
   models have been increasingly applied to predict survival data. The
   present research was conducted to compare log-logistic regression and
   artificial neural network models in prediction of breast cancer (BC)
   survival. Materials and Methods: A historical cohort study was
   established with 104 patients suffering from BC from 1997 to 2005. To
   compare the ANN and LLM in our setting, we used the estimated areas
   under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and
   integrated AUC (iAUC). The data were analyzed using R statistical
   software. Results: The AUC for the first, second and third years after
   diagnosis are 0.918, 0.780 and 0.800 in ANN, and 0.834, 0.733 and 0.616
   in LLM, respectively. The mean AUC for ANN was statistically higher than
   that of the LLM (0.845 vs. 0.744). Hence, this study showed a
   significant difference between the performance in terms of prediction by
   ANN and LLM. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the ability of
   prediction with ANN was higher than with the LLM model. Thus, the use of
   ANN method for prediction of survival in field of breast cancer is
   suggested.

   model-instruction-tuned LLM for assessment of cancer (iLLMAC)-that can
   detect cancer using cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) end-motif
   profiles. Developed on plasma cfDNA sequencing data from 1135 cancer
   patients and 1106 controls across three datasets, iLLMAC achieved area
   under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.866 [95% confidence
   interval (CI), 0.773-0.959] for cancer diagnosis and 0.924 (95% CI,
   0.841-1.0) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection using 16
   end-motifs. Performance increased with more motifs, reaching 0.886 (95%
   CI, 0.794-0.977) and 0.956 (95% CI, 0.89-1.0) for cancer diagnosis and
   HCC detection, respectively, with 64 end-motifs. On an external-testing
   set, iLLMAC achieved AUROC of 0.912 (95% CI, 0.849-0.976) for cancer
   diagnosis and 0.938 (95% CI, 0.885-0.992) for HCC detection with 64
   end-motifs, significantly outperforming benchmarked methods.
   Furthermore, iLLMAC achieved high classification performance on datasets
   with bisulfite and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine sequencing. Our study
   highlights the effectiveness of LLM-based instruction-tuning for

AB Background: Tumour markers are standard tools for the differential
   diagnosis of cancer. However, the occurrence of nonspecific symptoms and
   different malignancies involving the same cancer site may lead to a high
   proportion of misclassifications.
   Classification accuracy can be improved by combining information from
   different markers using standard data mining techniques, like Decision
   Tree (DT), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and k-Nearest Neighbour
   (KNN) classifier. Unfortunately, each method suffers from some
   unavoidable limitations. DT, in general, tends to show a low
   classification performance, whereas ANN and KNN produce a "black-box"
   classification that does not provide biological information useful for
   clinical purposes.
   Methods: Logic Learning Machine (LLM) is an innovative method of
   supervised data analysis capable of building classifiers described by a
   set of intelligible rules including simple conditions in their
   antecedent part. It is essentially an efficient implementation of the
   Switching Neural Network model and reaches excellent classification
   accuracy while keeping low the computational demand.
   LLM was applied to data from a consecutive cohort of 169 patients
   admitted for diagnosis to two pulmonary departments in Northern Italy
   from 2009 to 2011. Patients included 52 malignant pleural mesotheliomas
   (MPM), 62 pleural metastases (MTX) from other tumours and 55 benign
   diseases (BD) associated with pleurisies. Concentration of three tumour
   markers (CEA, CYFRA 21-1 and SMRP) was measured in the pleural fluid of
   each patient and a cytological examination was also carried out.
   The performance of LLM and that of three competing methods (DT, KNN and
   ANN) was assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation.
   Results: LLM outperformed all other considered methods. Global accuracy
   was 77.5% for LLM, 72.8% for DT, 54.4% for KNN, and 63.9% for ANN,
   respectively. In more details, LLM correctly classified 79% of MPM, 66%
   of MTX and 89% of BD. The corresponding figures for DT were: MPM = 83%,
   MTX = 55% and BD = 84%; for KNN: MPM = 58%, MTX = 45%, BD = 62%; for
   ANN: MPM = 71%, MTX = 47%, BD = 76%.
   Finally, LLM provided classification rules in a very good agreement with
   a priori knowledge about the biological role of the considered tumour
   markers.
   Conclusions: LLM is a new flexible tool potentially useful for the
   differential diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma.

AB This study aimed to investigate the performance of a fine-tuned large
   language model (LLM) in extracting patients on pretreatment for lung
   cancer from picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and
   comparing it with that of radiologists. Patients whose radiological
   reports contained the term lung cancer (3111 for training, 124 for
   validation, and 288 for test) were included in this retrospective study.
   Based on clinical indication and diagnosis sections of the radiological
   report (used as input data), they were classified into four groups (used
   as reference data): group 0 (no lung cancer), group 1 (pretreatment lung
   cancer present), group 2 (after treatment for lung cancer), and group 3
   (planning radiation therapy). Using the training and validation
   datasets, fine-tuning of the pretrained LLM was conducted ten times. Due
   to group imbalance, group 2 data were undersampled in the training. The
   performance of the best-performing model in the validation dataset was
   assessed in the independent test dataset. For testing purposes, two
   other radiologists (readers 1 and 2) were also involved in classifying
   radiological reports. The overall accuracy of the fine-tuned LLM, reader
   1, and reader 2 was 0.983, 0.969, and 0.969, respectively. The
   sensitivity for differentiating group 0/1/2/3 by LLM, reader 1, and
   reader 2 was 1.000/0.948/0.991/1.000, 0.750/0.879/0.996/1.000, and
   1.000/0.931/0.978/1.000, respectively. The time required for
   classification by LLM, reader 1, and reader 2 was 46s/2539s/1538s,
   respectively. Fine-tuned LLM effectively extracted patients on
   pretreatment for lung cancer from PACS with comparable performance to
   radiologists in a shorter time.

AB Breast cancer (BrCa), being one of the most prevalent forms of cancer in
   women, poses many challenges in the field of treatment and diagnosis due
   to its complex biological mechanisms. Early and accurate diagnosis plays
   a fundamental role in improving survival rates, but the limitations of
   existing imaging methods and clinical data interpretation often prevent
   optimal results. Large Language Models (LLMs), which are developed based
   on advanced architectures such as transformers, have brought about a
   significant revolution in data processing and medical decision-making.
   By analyzing a large volume of medical and clinical data, these models
   enable early diagnosis by identifying patterns in images and medical
   records and provide personalized treatment strategies by integrating
   genetic markers and clinical guidelines. Despite the transformative
   potential of these models, their use in BrCa management faces challenges
   such as data sensitivity, algorithm transparency, ethical
   considerations, and model compatibility with the details of medical
   applications that need to be addressed to achieve reliable results. This
   review systematically reviews the impact of LLMs on BrCa treatment and
   diagnosis. This study's objectives include analyzing the role of LLM
   technology in diagnosing and treating this disease. The findings
   indicate that the application of LLMs has resulted in significant
   improvements in various aspects of BrCa management, such as a 35%
   increase in the Efficiency of Diagnosis and BrCa Treatment (EDBC), a 30%
   enhancement in the System's Clinical Trust and Reliability (SCTR), and a
   20% improvement in the quality of patient education and information
   (IPEI). Ultimately, this study demonstrates the importance of LLMs in
   advancing precision medicine for BrCa and paves the way for effective
   patient-centered care solutions.

AB The ChatGPT, a lite and conversational variant of Generative Pretrained
   Transformer 4 (GPT-4) developed by OpenAI, is one of the milestone Large
   Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. LLMs have stirred up
   much interest among researchers and practitioners in their impressive
   skills in natural language processing tasks, which profoundly impact
   various fields. This paper mainly discusses the future applications of
   LLMs in dentistry. We introduce two primary LLM deployment methods in
   dentistry, including automated dental diagnosis and cross-modal dental
   diagnosis, and examine their potential applications. Especially,
   equipped with a cross-modal encoder, a single LLM can manage
   multi-source data and conduct advanced natural language reasoning to
   perform complex clinical operations. We also present cases to
   demonstrate the potential of a fully automatic Multi-Modal LLM AI system
   for dentistry clinical application. While LLMs offer significant
   potential benefits, the challenges, such as data privacy, data quality,
   and model bias, need further study. Overall, LLMs have the potential to
   revolutionize dental diagnosis and treatment, which indicates a
   promising avenue for clinical application and research in dentistry.

   This study is aimed to identify risk factors of LuM and LLM (lung
   metastasis with liver metastasis) from colon cancer, and to analyze the
   prognosis of patients with LuM by creating a nomogram. Patients'
   information were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results (SEER) database. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was
   used to determine the risk factors for LuM and LLM. Prognostic factors
   for cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were
   identified by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression and
   nomogram models were established to predict CSS and OS. Multivariate
   logistic regression analysis showed that blacks, splenic flexure of
   colon tumor, tumor size >5 cm, T4, N3, and higher lymph node positive
   rate were associated with the occurrence of LuM. Meanwhile, age >65
   years old, female, splenic flexure of colon, higher lymph node positive
   rate, and brain metastasis were independent risk factors for CSS. The
   C-index of the prediction model for CSS was 0.719 (95% CI: 0.691-0.747).
   In addition, age, primary site, tumor size, differentiation grade, N
   stage, and bone metastasis were significantly different between LuM and
   LLM. The nomograms we created were effective in predicting the survival
   of individuals. Furthermore, patients with LuM and LLM from colon cancer
   might require different follow-up intervals and examinations.

   personalized, accurate, and efficient medical care. This systematic
   review focuses on the intersection of AI-based digital twins and their
   applications in prostate cancer pathology. A digital twin, when applied
   to healthcare, creates a dynamic, data-driven virtual model that
   simulates a patient's biological systems in real-time. By incorporating
   AI techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL),
   these systems enhance predictive accuracy, enable early diagnosis, and
   facilitate individualized treatment strategies for prostate cancer. This
   review systematically examines recent advances (2020-2025) in AI-driven
   digital twins for prostate cancer, highlighting key methodologies,
   algorithms, and data integration strategies. The literature analysis
   also reveals substantial progress in image processing, predictive
   modeling, and clinical decision support systems, which are the basic
   tools used when implementing digital twins for prostate cancer care. Our
   survey also critically evaluates the strengths and limitations of
   current approaches, identifying gaps such as the need for real-time data
   integration, improved explainability in AI models, and more robust
   clinical validation. It concludes with a discussion of future research
   directions, emphasizing the importance of integrating multi-modal data
   with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
   scalability, and ethical considerations in advancing AI-driven digital
   twins for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. This paper provides a

AB Background: Clinical information improves imaging interpretation, but
   physician-provided histories on requisitions for oncologic imaging often
   lack key details. Purpose: To evaluate large language models (LLMs) for
   automatically generating clinical histories for oncologic imaging
   requisitions from clinical notes and compare them with original
   requisition histories. Materials and Methods: In total, 207 patients
   with CT performed at a cancer center from January to November 2023 and
   with an electronic health record clinical note coinciding with ordering
   date were randomly selected. A multidisciplinary team informed selection
   of 10 parameters important for oncologic imaging history, including
   primary oncologic diagnosis, treatment history, and acute symptoms.
   Clinical notes were independently reviewed to establish the reference
   standard regarding presence of each parameter. After prompt engineering
   with seven patients, GPT-4 (version 0613; OpenAI) was prompted on April
   9, 2024, to automatically generate structured clinical histories for the
   200 remaining patients. Using the reference standard, LLM extraction
   performance was calculated (recall, precision, F1 score). LLM-generated
   and original requisition histories were compared for completeness
   (proportion including each parameter), and 10 radiologists performed
   pairwise comparison for quality, preference, and subjective likelihood
   of harm. Results: For the 200 LLM-generated histories, GPT-4 performed
   well, extracting oncologic parameters from clinical notes (F1 = 0.983).
   Compared with original requisition histories, LLM-generated histories
   more frequently included parameters critical for radiologist
   interpretation, including primary oncologic diagnosis (99.5% vs 89% [199
   and 178 of 200 histories, respectively]; P < .001), acute or worsening
   symptoms (15% vs 4% [29 and seven of 200]; P < .001), and relevant
   surgery (61% vs 12% [122 and 23 of 200]; P < .001). Radiologists
   preferred LLM-generated histories for imaging interpretation (89% vs 5%,
   7% equal; P < .001), indicating they would enable more complete
   interpretation (86% vs 0%, 15% equal; P < .001) and have a lower

   LLM enabled accurate automated clinical histories for oncologic imaging
   from clinical notes. Compared with original requisition histories,
   LLM-generated histories were more complete and were preferred by
   radiologists for imaging interpretation and perceived safety.

AB ObjectivesHead and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a complex
   malignancy that requires a multidisciplinary tumor board approach for
   individual treatment planning. In recent years, artificial intelligence
   tools have emerged to assist healthcare professionals in making informed
   treatment decisions. This study investigates the application of the
   newly published LLM Claude 3 Opus compared to the currently most
   advanced LLM ChatGPT 4.0 for the diagnosis and therapy planning of
   primary HNSCC. The results were compared to that of a conventional
   multidisciplinary tumor board; (2) Materials and Methods: We conducted a
   study in March 2024 on 50 consecutive primary head and neck cancer
   cases. The diagnostics and MDT recommendations were compared to the
   Claude 3 Opus and ChatGPT 4.0 recommendations for each patient and rated
   by two independent reviewers for the following parameters: clinical
   recommendation, explanation, and summarization in addition to the
   Artificial Intelligence Performance Instrument (AIPI); (3) Results: In
   this study, Claude 3 achieved better scores for the diagnostic workup of
   patients than ChatGPT 4.0 and provided treatment recommendations
   involving surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In terms of
   clinical recommendations, explanation and summarization Claude 3 scored
   similar to ChatGPT 4.0, listing treatment recommendations which were
   congruent with the MDT, but failed to cite the source of the
   information; (4) Conclusion: This study is the first analysis of Claude
   3 for primary head and neck cancer cases and demonstrates a superior
   performance in the diagnosis of HNSCC than ChatGPT 4.0 and similar
   results for therapy recommendations. This marks the advent of a newly
   launched advanced AI model that may be superior to ChatGPT 4.0 for the
   assessment of primary head and neck cancer cases and may assist in the
   clinical diagnostic and MDT setting.

AB The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is
   revolutionizing diagnosis and patient care by improving clinical
   documentation and the management of electronic health records that
   depend on medical image interpretation, increasing accuracy, and
   reducing time. Egypt ranks first in liver disease and second in liver
   cancer mortality worldwide in 2020. Large language models, a subset of
   AI techniques, can assist in disease diagnosis. LLM models with
   multimodal capabilities can classify and describe patient scan images
   and extract information from clinical notes. These models can extract
   vital diagnoses with the support of prompt engineering, as one of these
   models can answer questions, summarize information, and translate
   complex medical terminology into plain language, enabling patients to
   understand their medical reports and diagnoses. There are two primary
   approaches to achieving this. First, fine-tuning can adapt the model to
   medical data, which can be resource-intensive. The second approach,
   pre-trained LLM models can be utilized to leverage pre-trained models to
   perform the necessary tasks, focusing on effectively using prompts to
   guide the model for precise and relevant outputs. This study highlights
   the role of generative AI models by focusing on prompt engineering, and
   how carefully crafting prompts can enhance the effectiveness of LLM
   models in medical applications with high accuracy. It demonstrates this
   through experiments using pre-trained models based on semantic
   similarity with GPT-4o and BioGPT. Implementing a zero-shot model for
   liver tumor classification is one of the prompt engineering techniques.
   The performance metrics achieved were impressive, accuracy, precision,
   recall, and F1-scores are 88, 81, 88, and 83 percent, respectively.

AB Laryngeal leiomyosarcoma (LLM) is a rare malignancy originating from the
   smooth muscles of blood vessels or from aberrant undifferentiated
   mesenchymal tissue. Histological diagnosis may be particularly difficult
   and correct diagnosis is based on immunohistochemical investigations and
   electron microscopy. A case report of a LLM in a 74-year-old man is
   presented. Direct laryngoscopy revealed a large glottic lesion causing
   airway compromise and an emergency tracheotomy was performed. Subsequent
   total laryngectomy confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma. Lung
   metastases developed 8 months following treatment, despite the absence
   of local or regional recurrence, and the patient died 3 months later. A
   review of the English and French literature revealed 30 previous cases
   of LLM. Clinical presentation, histological diagnosis, and management of
   this rare malignancy are analyzed aiming to improve our knowledge
   regarding the best treatment modality.

AB Clinical staging of liver cancer (CSoLC), an important indicator for
   evaluating primary liver cancer (PLC), is key in the diagnosis,
   treatment, and rehabilitation of liver cancer. In China, the current
   CSoLC adopts the China liver cancer (CNLC) staging, which is usually
   evaluated by clinicians based on radiology reports. Therefore, inferring
   clinical information from unstructured radiology reports can provide
   auxiliary decision support for clinicians. The key to solving the
   challenging task is to guide the model to pay attention to the
   staging-related words or sentences, and the following issues may occur:
   1) Imbalanced categories: Early- and mid-stage liver cancer symptoms are
   subtle, resulting in more data in the end-stage. 2) Domain sensitivity
   of liver cancer data: The liver cancer dataset contains substantial
   domain knowledge, leading to out-of-vocabulary issues and reduced
   classification accuracy. 3) Free-text and lengthy report: Radiology
   reports sparsely describe various lesions using domain-specific terms,
   making it hard to mine staging-related information. To address these,
   this article proposes a large language model (LLM)-based Knowledge-aware
   Attention Network (LKAN) for CSoLC. First, for maintaining semantic
   consistency, LLM and a rule-based algorithm are integrated to generate
   more diverse and reasonable data. Second, an unlabeled radiology corpus
   is pre-trained to introduce domain knowledge for subsequent
   representation learning. Third, attention is improved by incorporating
   both global and local features to guide the model's focus on
   staging-relevant information. Compared with the baseline models, LKAN
   has achieved the best results with 90.3% Accuracy, 90.0% Macro_F1 score,
   and 90.0% Macro_Recall.

AB BackgroundIncrease in early onset colorectal cancer makes adherence to
   screening a significant public health concern, with various social
   determinants playing a crucial role in its incidence, diagnosis,
   treatment, and outcomes. Stressful life events, such as divorce,
   marriage, or sudden loss of job, have a unique position among the social
   determinants of health.MethodsWe applied a large language model (LLM) to
   social history sections of clinical notes in the health records database
   of the Medical University of South Carolina to extract recent stressful
   life events and assess their impact on colorectal cancer screening
   adherence. We used pattern-matching regular expressions to detect a
   possible signal in social histories and ran LLM four times on each
   social history to achieve self-consistency and then used logistic
   regression to estimate the impact of life events on the probability of
   having a code in health records related to colorectal cancer
   screening.ResultsThe LLM detected 380 patients with one or more
   stressful life events and 5,344 patients with no life events. The events
   with the most negative impact on screening were arrest or incarceration
   (OR 0.26 95% CI 0.06-0.77), becoming homeless (OR 0.18 95% CI
   0.01-0.92), separation from spouse or partner (OR 0.32 95% CI
   0.05-1.18), getting married or starting to live with a partner (OR 0.60
   95% CI 0.19-1.53). Death of somebody close to the patient (excluding
   their spouse) increased the chance of screening (OR 1.21 95% CI
   0.71-2.05). Many of the observed effects did not reach statistical
   significance.ConclusionOur findings suggest that stressful life events
   might have a counterintuitive impact on screening, with some events,
   such as bereavement, were associated with increased screening. Future
   work should be focused on validating the research findings using data
   from other health institutions. In addition, expanding the list of
   stressful life events by including a validated scale of stressful life
   events for patients from historically marginalized groups is warranted.

AB BackgroundMultidisciplinary teams (MDTs) are essential for cancer care
   but are resource-intensive. Decision-making processes within MDTs, while
   critical, contribute to increased healthcare costs due to the need for
   specialist time and coordination. The recent emergence of large language
   models (LLMs) offers the potential to improve the efficiency and
   accuracy of clinical decision-making processes, potentially reducing
   costs associated with traditional MDT models.MethodsWe conducted a
   retrospective study of 171 consecutively treated patients with newly
   diagnosed prostate cancer. Relevant structured clinical data and the
   European Association of Urology (EAU) pocket guidelines were provided to
   two LLMs (chatGPT-4, Claude-3-Opus). LLM treatment recommendations were
   compared to actual treatment recommendations of the MDT meeting
   (MDM).ResultsBoth LLMs demonstrated an overall adherence of 93% with the
   MDT treatment recommendations. Discrepancies between LLM and MDT
   recommendations were observed in 15 cases (9%), primarily due to lack of
   clinical information that could be provided to the LLMs. In 5 cases
   (3%), the LLM recommendations were not in line with EAU guidelines
   despite having access to all relevant information.ConclusionsOur
   findings provide evidence that LLMs can provide accurate treatment
   recommendations for newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. LLMs have
   the potential to streamline MDT workflows, enabling specialists to focus
   on complex cases and patient-centered discussions.Patient SummaryIn this
   study, we explored the potential of artificial intelligence models
   called large language models (LLMs) to assist in treatment
   decision-making for prostate cancer patients. We found that LLMs, when
   provided with patient information and clinical guidelines, can recommend
   treatments that closely match those made by a team of cancer
   specialists, suggesting that LLMs could help streamline the
   decision-making process and potentially reduce healthcare costs.

AB Large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in the field of
   medical diagnosis. There are still many challenges in the direct
   diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is
   a commonly used tumor marker for liver cancer. However, relying on AFP
   can result in missed diagnoses of HCC. We developed an artificial
   intelligence (AI) agent centered on LLMs, named ChatExosome, which
   created an interactive and convenient system for clinical spectroscopic
   analysis and diagnosis. ChatExosome consists of two main components: the
   first is the deep learning of the Raman fingerprinting of exosomes
   derived from HCC. Based on a patch-based 1D self-attention mechanism and
   downsampling, the feature fusion transformer (FFT) was designed to
   process the Raman spectra of exosomes. It achieved accuracies of 95.8%
   for cell-derived exosomes and 94.1% for 165 clinical samples,
   respectively. The second component is the interactive chat agent based
   on LLM. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method was utilized to
   enhance the knowledge related to exosomes. Overall, LLM serves as the
   core of this interactive system, which is capable of identifying users'
   intentions and invoking the appropriate plugins to process the Raman
   data of exosomes. This is the first AI agent focusing on exosome
   spectroscopy and diagnosis, enhancing the interpretability of
   classification results, enabling physicians to leverage cutting-edge
   medical research and artificial intelligence techniques to optimize
   medical decision-making processes, and it shows great potential in
   intelligent diagnosis.

AB Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) continues to be a leading cause of
   cancer-related deaths among women. This work introduces an innovative
   non-invasive breast cancer classification model designed to improve the
   identification of cancer metastases. While this study marks the initial
   exploration into predicting MBC, additional investigations are essential
   to validate the occurrence of MBC. Our approach combines the strengths
   of large language models (LLMs), specifically the bidirectional encoder
   representations from transformers (BERT) model, with the powerful
   capabilities of graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict MBC patients
   based on their histopathology reports. This paper introduces a BERT-GNN
   approach for metastatic breast cancer prediction (BG-MBC) that
   integrates graph information derived from the BERT model. In this model,
   nodes are constructed from patient medical records, while BERT
   embeddings are employed to vectorise representations of the words in
   histopathology reports, thereby capturing semantic information crucial
   for classification by employing three distinct approaches (namely
   univariate selection, extra trees classifier for feature importance, and
   Shapley values to identify the features that have the most significant
   impact). Identifying the most crucial 30 features out of 676 generated
   as embeddings during model training, our model further enhances its
   predictive capabilities. The BG-MBC model achieves outstanding accuracy,
   with a detection rate of 0.98 and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.98, in
   identifying MBC patients. This remarkable performance is credited to the
   model's utilisation of attention scores generated by the LLM from
   histopathology reports, effectively capturing pertinent features for
   classification.

AB Diagnosing melanoma remains challenging despite advances in
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for skin cancer detection. Their
   application in clinical settings is often limited by differences between
   natural and clinical images. To address this, we introduce the Skin
   Cancer Detection Neural Architecture Search (SCD-NAS) framework. In our
   method, Large Language Model (LLM) is leveraged as a proxy, which helps
   SCD-NAS achieve cost-free training. Additionally, to maximize the
   benefits of various architectural design spaces, we introduce a Search
   Space Expansion (SSE) methodology. This effectively combines the merits
   of diverse architectural configurations, thereby enhancing model
   performance. We conducted experiments on the ISIC 2020, MedMNISTv2,
   CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our SCD-NAS-derived ResNet50 model
   achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 91.23% on the ISIC 2020
   dataset, improving the baseline by 5.93%. It also exceeded the CIFAR-10
   benchmark by 2.45% in accuracy.

AB Medical researchers are increasingly utilizing advanced LLMs like
   ChatGPT-4 and Gemini to enhance diagnostic processes in the medical
   field. This research focuses on their ability to comprehend and apply
   complex medical classification systems for breast conditions, which can
   significantly aid plastic surgeons in making informed decisions for
   diagnosis and treatment, ultimately leading to improved patient
   outcomes. Fifty clinical scenarios were created to evaluate the
   classification accuracy of each LLM across five established
   breast-related classification systems. Scores from 0 to 2 were assigned
   to LLM responses to denote incorrect, partially correct, or completely
   correct classifications. Descriptive statistics were employed to compare
   the performances of ChatGPT-4 and Gemini. Gemini exhibited superior
   overall performance, achieving 98% accuracy compared to ChatGPT-4's 71%.
   While both models performed well in the Baker classification for
   capsular contracture and UTSW classification for gynecomastia, Gemini
   consistently outperformed ChatGPT-4 in other systems, such as the
   Fischer Grade Classification for gender-affirming mastectomy, Kajava
   Classification for ectopic breast tissue, and Regnault Classification
   for breast ptosis. With further development, integrating LLMs into
   plastic surgery practice will likely enhance diagnostic support and
   decision making.

AB Background: Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) for MRI
   helps assign malignancy risk, but radiologist adoption is inconsistent.
   Automatic assignment of O-RADS scores from reports could increase
   adoption and accuracy. Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of large
   language models (LLMs), after strategic optimization, for automatically
   calculating O-RADS scores from reports. Materials and Methods: This
   retrospective single-center study from a large quaternary care cancer
   center included consecutive gadolinium chelate-enhanced pelvic MRI
   reports with at least one assigned O-RADS score from July 2021 to
   October 2023. Reports from January 2018 to October 2019 (before O-RADS
   MRI implementation) were randomly selected for additional testing.
   Reference standard O-RADS scores were determined by radiologists
   interpreting reports. After prompt optimization using a subset of
   reports, two LLM-based strategies were evaluated: few-shot learning with
   GPT-4 (version 0613; OpenAI) prompted with O-RADS rules ("LLM only") and
   a hybrid strategy leveraging GPT-4 to classify features fed into a
   deterministic formula ("hybrid"). Accuracy of each model and originally
   reported scores were calculated and compared using the McNemar test.
   Results: A total of 284 reports from 284 female patients (mean age, 53.2
   years +/- 16.3 [SD]) with 372 adnexal lesions were included: 10 reports
   in the training set (16 lesions), 134 reports in the internal test set 1
   (173 lesions; 158 O-RADS assigned), and 140 reports in internal test set
   2 (183 lesions). For assigning O-RADS MRI scores, the hybrid model
   accuracy (97%; 168 of 173) outperformed LLM-only model (90%; 155 of 173;
   P = .006). For lesions with an originally reported O-RADS score, hybrid
   model accuracy exceeded that of reporting radiologists (97% [153 of 158]
   vs 88% [139 of 158]; P = .004). Hybrid model also outperformed LLM-only
   model for 183 lesions from before O-RADS implementation (95% [173 of
   183] vs 87% [159 of 183], respectively; P = .01). Conclusion: A hybrid
   LLM-based application, combining LLM feature classification with
   deterministic elements, accurately assigned O-RADS MRI scores from
   report descriptions, exceeding both an LLM-only strategy and the
   original reporting radiologist. (c) RSNA, 2025

AB PurposeCaregivers in pediatric oncology need accurate and understandable
   information about their child's condition, treatment, and side effects.
   This study assesses the performance of publicly accessible large
   language model (LLM)-supported tools in providing valuable and reliable
   information to caregivers of children with cancer. MethodsIn this
   cross-sectional study, we evaluated the performance of the four
   LLM-supported tools-ChatGPT (GPT-4), Google Bard (Gemini Pro), Microsoft
   Bing Chat, and Google SGE-against a set of frequently asked questions
   (FAQs) derived from the Children's Oncology Group Family Handbook and
   expert input (In total, 26 FAQs and 104 generated responses). Five
   pediatric oncology experts assessed the generated LLM responses using
   measures including accuracy, clarity, inclusivity, completeness,
   clinical utility, and overall rating. Additionally, the content quality
   was evaluated including readability, AI disclosure, source credibility,
   resource matching, and content originality. We used descriptive analysis
   and statistical tests including Shapiro-Wilk, Levene's, Kruskal-Wallis
   H-tests, and Dunn's post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons.
   ResultsChatGPT shows high overall performance when evaluated by the
   experts. Bard also performed well, especially in accuracy and clarity of
   the responses, whereas Bing Chat and Google SGE had lower overall
   scores. Regarding the disclosure of responses being generated by AI, it
   was observed less frequently in ChatGPT responses, which may have
   affected the clarity of responses, whereas Bard maintained a balance
   between AI disclosure and response clarity. Google SGE generated the
   most readable responses whereas ChatGPT answered with the most
   complexity. LLM tools varied significantly (p < 0.001) across all expert
   evaluations except inclusivity. Through our thematic analysis of expert
   free-text comments, emotional tone and empathy emerged as a unique theme
   with mixed feedback on expectations from AI to be empathetic.
   ConclusionLLM-supported tools can enhance caregivers' knowledge of
   pediatric oncology. Each model has unique strengths and areas for
   improvement, indicating the need for careful selection based on specific
   clinical contexts. Further research is required to explore their
   application in other medical specialties and patient demographics,
   assessing broader applicability and long-term impacts.

AB Background and aim In the last years, natural language processing (NLP)
   has transformed significantly with the introduction of large language
   models (LLM). This review updates on NLP and LLM applications and
   challenges in gastroenterology and hepatology. Methods Registered with
   PROSPERO (CRD42024542275) and adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we searched
   six databases for relevant studies published from 2003 to 2024,
   ultimately including 57 studies. Results Our review of 57 studies notes
   an increase in relevant publications in 2023-2024 compared to previous
   years, reflecting growing interest in newer models such as GPT-3 and
   GPT-4. The results demonstrate that NLP models have enhanced data
   extraction from electronic health records and other unstructured medical
   data sources. Key findings include high precision in identifying disease
   characteristics from unstructured reports and ongoing improvement in
   clinical decision-making. Risk of bias assessments using ROBINS-I,
   QUADAS-2, and PROBAST tools confirmed the methodological robustness of
   the included studies. Conclusion NLP and LLMs can enhance diagnosis and
   treatment in gastroenterology and hepatology. They enable extraction of
   data from unstructured medical records, such as endoscopy reports and
   patient notes, and for enhancing clinical decision-making. Despite these
   advancements, integrating these tools into routine practice is still
   challenging. Future work should prospectively demonstrate real-world
   value.

AB Background and Objectives: Radiomics is widely used to assist in
   clinical decision-making, disease diagnosis, and treatment planning for
   various target organs, including the breast. Recent advances in large
   language models (LLMs) have helped enhance radiomics analysis. Materials
   and Methods: Herein, we sought to improve radiomics analysis by
   incorporating LLM-learned clinical knowledge, to classify benign and
   malignant tumors in breast mammography. We extracted radiomics features
   from the mammograms based on the region of interest and retained the
   features related to the target task. Using prompt engineering, we
   devised an input sequence that reflected the selected features and the
   target task. The input sequence was fed to the chosen LLM (LLaMA
   variant), which was fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation to enhance
   radiomics features. This was then evaluated on two mammogram datasets
   (VinDr-Mammo and INbreast) against conventional baselines. Results: The
   enhanced radiomics-based method performed better than baselines using
   conventional radiomics features tested on two mammogram datasets,
   achieving accuracies of 0.671 for the VinDr-Mammo dataset and 0.839 for
   the INbreast dataset. Conventional radiomics models require retraining
   from scratch for an unseen dataset using a new set of features. In
   contrast, the model developed in this study effectively reused the
   common features between the training and unseen datasets by explicitly
   linking feature names with feature values, leading to extensible
   learning across datasets. Our method performed better than the baseline
   method in this retraining setting using an unseen dataset. Conclusions:
   Our method, one of the first to incorporate LLM into radiomics, has the
   potential to improve radiomics analysis.

AB Objective To develop a non-invasive, radiation-free model for early
   colorectal adenoma prediction using clinical electronic medical record
   (EMR) data, addressing limitations in current diagnostic approaches for
   large-scale screening.Design Retrospective analysis utilized 92,681
   cases with EMR, spanning from 2012 to 2022, as the training cohort.
   Testing was performed on an independent test cohort of 19,265 cases from
   2023. Several classical machine learning algorithms were applied in
   combination with the BGE-M3 large-language model (LLM) for enhanced
   semantic feature extraction. Area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (AUC) is the major metric for evaluating model
   performance. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was
   employed to identify the most influential risk factors.Results XGBoost
   algorithm, integrated with BGE-M3, demonstrated superior performance
   (AUC = 0.9847) in the validation cohort. Notably, when applied to the
   independent test cohort, XGBoost maintained its strong predictive
   ability with an AUC of 0.9839 and an average advance prediction time of
   6.88 hours, underscoring the effectiveness of the BGE-M3 model. The SHAP
   analysis further identified 16 high-impact risk factors, highlighting
   the interplay of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental influences on
   colorectal adenoma risk.Conclusion This study developed a robust machine
   learning-based model for colorectal adenoma risk prediction, leveraging
   clinical EMR and LLM. The proposed model demonstrates high predictive
   accuracy and has the potential to enhance early detection, making it
   well-suited for large-scale screening programs. By facilitating early
   identification of individuals at risk, this approach may contribute to
   reducing the incidence and mortality associated with colorectal cancer.

AB Aims Inconclusive findings of lipid-lowering medications (LLMs) on
   cancer survival benefit require more evidence. We tested the hypothesis
   that adherence to this drug is associated with reduced cancer-specific
   mortality in a homogeneous population who had used this drug before
   cancer diagnosis. Methods The Australian Cancer Database was linked to
   the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme database, and to the National Death
   Index (up to 2015). Medication adherence was calculated by proportion of
   days covered. Cox regression models with time-varying covariates were
   used to derive multivariable-adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio (HR)
   and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the associations between adherence
   to LLMs, statins, lipophilic, and hydrophilic statins and
   cancer-specific mortality. Results From 2003 to 2013, 3 separate cohorts
   of 20 046, 11 719 and 6430 female patients with newly diagnosed breast,
   colorectal cancer, and melanoma respectively were identified. The 1-year
   adherence was similar at 1-year prediagnosis in the 3 cohorts, on
   average 82%. Each 10% increase in 1-year adherence to LLMs was inversely
   associated with cancer-specific mortality among women with breast cancer
   (fully adjusted HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.91-0.93), colorectal cancer (fully
   adjusted HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.91-0.93), or melanoma (fully adjusted HR =
   0.97, 95% CI 0.94-1.00). The reductions in cancer-specific mortality
   were more pronounced for women who adhered to lipophilic than
   hydrophilic statins in all 3 cancers albeit not statistically
   significant for melanoma. Conclusion Among LLM users, adherence to this
   drug is associated with a decrease in cancer-specific mortality. If
   confirmed, LLMs could be considered as an adjuvant cancer therapy to
   improve prognosis in cancer survivors.

   for prognosis improvement. This study aimed to investigate the
   feasibility of a fine-tuned, locally run large language model (LLM) in
   extracting patients with bone metastasis in unstructured Japanese
   radiology report and to compare its performance with manual annotation.
   This retrospective study included patients with "metastasis" in
   radiological reports (April 2018-January 2019, August-May 2022, and
   April-December 2023 for training, validation, and test datasets of 9559,
   1498, and 7399 patients, respectively). Radiologists reviewed the
   clinical indication and diagnosis sections of the radiological report
   (used as input data) and classified them into groups 0 (no bone
   metastasis), 1 (progressive bone metastasis), and 2 (stable or decreased
   bone metastasis). The data for group 0 was under-sampled in training and
   test datasets due to group imbalance. The best-performing model from the
   validation set was subsequently tested using the testing dataset. Two
   additional radiologists (readers 1 and 2) were involved in classifying
   radiological reports within the test dataset for testing purposes. The
   fine-tuned LLM, reader 1, and reader 2 demonstrated an accuracy of
   0.979, 0.996, and 0.993, sensitivity for groups 0/1/2 of

   improve the validity of scientific writing, task-specific and
   domain-specific language models may be required. In turn, we propose a
   bespoke, proprietary ovarian cancer-specific natural language using
   solely in-domain text, whereas transfer learning drifts away from the
   pretrained language models to fine-tune task-specific models for all
   possible downstream applications. This venture will be fueled by the
   abundance of unstructured text information in the electronic health
   records resulting in ovarian cancer research ultimately reaching its
   linguistic home.

AB Tumor-associated microglia and macrophages (TAM) make up the largest
   immune cell population in the glioblastoma (GBM) tumor microenvironment.
   Given the heterogeneity and plasticity of TAMs in the GBM tumor
   microenvironment, understanding the context-dependent cancer cell-TAM
   symbiotic interaction is crucial for understanding GBM biology and
   developing effective therapies. In a recent issue of Cell, Kloosterman
   and colleagues identified a subpopulation of glycoprotein nonmetastatic
   melanoma protein Bhigh lipid-laden microglia and macrophages (LLM) in
   GBM. Mesenchymal-like GBM cells help generate the LLM phenotype.
   Reciprocally, LLMs are epigenetically rewired to recycle myelin and
   transfer the lipid from myelin to cancer cells, fueling mesenchymal-like
   GBM progression in a liver X receptor/ABCA1-dependent manner. Together,
   leveraging LLMs opens new therapeutic possibilities for rewiring the
   metabolism-mediated tumor-TAM interaction during GBM progression.

AB Millions of people worldwide are battling cancer, and personalised care
   plans are essential for effective diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring
   of this disease. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven
   valuable in cancer treatment, for instance, extracting key information
   from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). This study presents a
   transformer encoder based LLM, that is domain adapted for Oncology, and
   outperforms generic models in recognising critical oncology related
   elements from clinical text. We observe that the development of such
   domain specific LLMs demands a huge amount of data and computational
   resources, which is a deterrent to the sustainability development goal
   of equitable health. To address this problem, we propose a federated
   learning approach for model development that will eliminate data sharing
   and centralised computational resource costs. Our evaluations show that
   the federated approach outperforms the generic base model, highlighting
   the advantages of collaborative learning in capturing domain specific
   knowledge and enhancing performance in oncology related NLP tasks. Our
   work is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
   (SDGs) which are aimed at promoting equitable health and narrowing down
   the differences in access to advanced cancer treatment.

AB Background: Traditional rule-based natural language processing
   approaches in electronic health record systems are effective but are
   often time-consuming and proneto errors when handling unstructured data.
   This is primarily dueto the substantial manual effort required to parse
   and extract information from diverse types of documentation. Recent
   advancements in large language model (LLM) technology have made it
   possible to automatically interpret medical context and support
   pathologic staging. However, existing LLMs encounter challenges in
   rapidly adapting to specialized guideline updates. In this study, we
   fine-tuned an LLM specifically for lung cancer pathologic staging,
   enabling it to incorporate the latest guidelines for pathologic TN
   classification. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the performance
   of fine-tuned generative language models in automatically inferring
   pathologic TN classifications and extracting their rationale from lung
   cancer surgical pathology reports. By addressing the inefficiencies and
   extensive parsing efforts associated with rule-based methods, this
   approach seeks to enable rapid and accurate reclassification aligned
   with the latest cancer staging guidelines. Methods: We conducted a
   comparative performance evaluation of 6 open-source LLMs for automated
   TN classification and rationale generation, using 3216 deidentified lung
   cancer surgical pathology reports based on the AmericanJointCommitteeon
   Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual8th edition, collected from a
   tertiary hospital. The dataset was preprocessed by segmenting each
   report according to lesion location and morphological diagnosis.
   Performance was assessed using exact match ratio (EMR) and semantic
   match ratio (SMR) as evaluation metrics, which measureclassification
   accuracy and the contextual alignment of the generated rationales,
   respectively. Results: Among the 6 models, the Orca2_13b model achieved
   the highest performance with an EMR of 0.934 and an SMR of 0.864.
   TheOrca2_7b model also demonstrated strong performance, recording an EMR
   of 0.914 and an SMR of 0.854. In contrast, the Llama2_7b model achieved
   an EMR of 0.864 and an SMR of 0.771, while the Llama2_13b model showed
   an EMR of 0.762 and an SMR of 0.690. The Mistral_7b and Llama3_8b
   models, on the other hand, showed lower performance, with EMRs of 0.572
   and 0.489, and SMRs of 0.377 and 0.456, respectively. Overall, the Orca2
   models consistently outperformed the others in both TN stage
   classification and rationale generation. Conclusions: The generative
   language model approach presented in this study has the potential to
   enhance and automate TN classification in complex cancer staging,
   supporting both clinical practice and oncology data curation. With
   additional fine-tuning based on cancer-specific guidelines, this
   approach can be effectively adapted to other cancer types.

AB PURPOSE To explore the perceived utility and effect of simplified
   radiology reports on oncology patients' knowledge and feasibility of
   large language models (LLMs) to generate such reports. MATERIALS AND
   METHODS This study was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee. In
   phase I, five state-of-the-art LLMs (Generative Pre-Trained
   Transformer-4o [GPT-4o], Google Gemini, Claude Opus, Llama-3.1-8B, and
   Phi-3.5-mini) were tested to simplify 50 oncology computed tomography
   (CT) report impressions using five distinct prompts with each LLM. The
   outputs were evaluated quantitatively using readability indices. Five
   LLM-prompt combinations with best average readability scores were also
   assessed qualitatively, and the best LLM-prompt combination was
   selected. In phase II, 100 consecutive oncology patients were randomly
   assigned into two groups: original report (received original report
   impression) and simplified report (received LLM-generated simplified
   versions of their CT report impressions under the supervision of a
   radiologist). A questionnaire assessed the impact of these reports on
   patients' knowledge and perceived utility. RESULTS In phase I, Claude
   Opus-Prompt 3 (explain to a 15-year-old) performed slightly better than
   other LLMs, although scores for GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude Opus, and
   Llama-3.1 were not significantly different (P > .0033 on Wilcoxon
   signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction). In phase II, simplified
   report group patients demonstrated significantly better knowledge of
   primary site and extent of their disease as well as showed significantly
   higher confidence and understanding of the report (P < .05 for all).
   Only three (of 50) simplified reports required corrections by the
   radiologist. CONCLUSION Simplified radiology reports significantly
   enhanced patients' understanding and confidence in comprehending their
   medical condition. LLMs performed very well at this simplification task;
   therefore, they can be potentially used for this purpose, although there
   remains a need for human oversight.

   advancing medical diagnosis recently, particularly in dermatological
   diagnosis, which is a very important task as skin and subcutaneous
   diseases rank high among the leading contributors to the global burden
   of nonfatal diseases. Here we present SkinGPT-4, which is an interactive
   dermatology diagnostic system based on multimodal large language models.
   We have aligned a pre-trained vision transformer with an LLM named
   Llama-2-13b-chat by collecting an extensive collection of skin disease
   images (comprising 52,929 publicly available and proprietary images)
   along with clinical concepts and doctors' notes, and designing a
   two-step training strategy. We have quantitatively evaluated SkinGPT-4
   on 150 real-life cases with board-certified dermatologists. With
   SkinGPT-4, users could upload their own skin photos for diagnosis, and
   the system could autonomously evaluate the images, identify the
   characteristics and categories of the skin conditions, perform in-depth
   analysis, and provide interactive treatment recommendations.
   Here, authors develop SkinGPT-4, an interactive dermatology diagnostic
   system that uses multimodal large language models and aligns a vision
   transformer with Llama-2-13b-chat. Evaluated by dermatologists, it
   offers autonomous diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

   have been publicly available and increasingly utilized by the general
   public since late 2022. This study sought to investigate ChatGPT
   responses to common patient questions regarding Human Papilloma Virus
   (HPV) positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). Methods: This was a
   prospective, multi-institutional study, with data collected from high
   volume institutions that perform >50 transoral robotic surgery cases per
   year. The 100 most recent discussion threads including the term "HPV" on
   the American Cancer Society's Cancer Survivors Network's Head and Neck
   Cancer public discussion board were reviewed. The 11 most common
   questions were serially queried to ChatGPT 3.5; answers were recorded. A
   survey was distributed to fellowship trained head and neck oncologic
   surgeons at 3 institutions to evaluate the responses. Results: A total
   of 8 surgeons participated in the study. For questions regarding HPV
   contraction and transmission, ChatGPT answers were scored as clinically
   accurate and aligned with consensus in the head and neck surgical
   oncology community 84.4% and 90.6% of the time, respectively. For
   questions involving treatment of HPV+ OPC, ChatGPT was clinically
   accurate and aligned with consensus 87.5% and 91.7% of the time,
   respectively. For questions regarding the HPV vaccine, ChatGPT was
   clinically accurate and aligned with consensus 62.5% and 75% of the
   time, respectively. When asked about circulating tumor DNA testing, only
   12.5% of surgeons thought responses were accurate or consistent with
   consensus. Conclusion: ChatGPT 3.5 performed poorly with questions
   involving evolving therapies and diagnostics-thus, caution should be
   used when using a platform like ChatGPT 3.5 to assess use of advanced
   technology. Patients should be counseled on the importance of consulting
   their surgeons to receive accurate and up to date recommendations, and
   use LLM's to augment their understanding of these important
   health-related topics.

AB Large language models (LLMs) offer potential benefits in clinical care.
   However, concerns remain regarding socio-demographic biases embedded in
   their outputs. Opioid prescribing is one domain in which these biases
   can have serious implications, especially given the ongoing opioid
   epidemic and the need to balance effective pain management with
   addiction risk. We tested ten LLMs-both open-access and closed-source-on
   1,000 acute-pain vignettes. Half of the vignettes were labeled as
   non-cancer and half as cancer. Each vignette was presented in 34
   socio-demographic variations, including a control group without
   demographic identifiers. We analyzed the models' recommendations on
   opioids, anxiety treatment, perceived psychological stress, risk scores,
   and monitoring recommendations. Overall, yielding 3.4 million
   model-generated responses. Using logistic and linear mixed-effects
   models, we measured how these outputs varied by demographic group and
   whether a cancer diagnosis intensified or reduced observed disparities.
   Across both cancer and non-cancer cases, historically marginalized
   groups-especially cases labeled as individuals who are unhoused, Black,
   or identify as LGBTQIA+-often received more or stronger opioid
   recommendations, sometimes exceeding 90% in cancer settings, despite
   being labeled as high risk by the same models. Meanwhile, low-income or
   unemployed groups were assigned elevated risk scores yet fewer opioid
   recommendations, hinting at inconsistent rationales. Disparities in
   anxiety treatment and perceived psychological stress similarly clustered
   within marginalized populations, even when clinical details were
   identical. These patterns diverged from standard guidelines and point to
   model-driven bias rather than acceptable clinical variation. Our
   findings underscore the need for rigorous bias evaluation and the
   integration of guideline-based checks in LLMs to ensure equitable and
   evidence-based pain care.

AB The main challenges hindering the adoption of deep learning-based
   systems in clinical settings are the scarcity of annotated data and the
   lack of interpretability and trust in these systems. Concept Bottleneck
   Models (CBMs) offer inherent interpretability by constraining the final
   disease prediction on a set of human-understandable concepts. However,
   this inherent interpretability comes at the cost of greater annotation
   burden. Additionally, adding new concepts requires retraining the entire
   system. In this work, we introduce a novel two-step methodology that
   addresses both of these challenges. By simulating the two stages of a
   CBM, we utilize a pretrained Vision Language Model (VLM) to
   automatically predict clinical concepts, and an off-the-shelf Large
   Language Model (LLM) to generate disease diagnoses grounded on the
   predicted concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports test-time human
   intervention, enabling corrections to predicted concepts, which improves
   final diagnoses and enhances transparency in decision-making. We
   validate our approach on three skin lesion datasets, demonstrating that
   it outperforms traditional CBMs and state-of-the-art explainable
   methods, all without requiring any training and utilizing only a few
   annotated examples. The code is available at

AB Background: The disease burden of breast cancer is increasing in China.
   Guiding people to obtain accurate information on breast cancer and
   improving the public's health literacy are crucial for the early
   detection and timely treatment of breast cancer. Large language model
   (LLM) is a currently popular source of health information. However, the
   accuracy and practicality of the breast cancer-related information
   provided by LLMs have not yet been evaluated. Objective: This study aims
   to evaluate and compare the accuracy, practicality, and
   generalization-specificity of responses to breast cancer-related
   questions from two LLMs, ChatGPT and ERNIE Bot (EB). Methods: The
   questions asked to the LLMs consisted of a patient questionnaire and an
   expert questionnaire, each containing 15 questions. ChatGPT was queried
   in both Chinese and English, recorded as ChatGPT-Chinese (ChatGPT-C) and
   ChatGPT-English (ChatGPT-E) respectively, while EB was queried in
   Chinese. The accuracy, practicality, and generalization-specificity of
   each inquiry's responses were rated by a breast cancer multidisciplinary
   treatment team using Likert scales. Results: Overall, for both the
   patient and expert questionnaire, the accuracy and practicality of
   responses from ChatGPT-E were significantly higher than those from
   ChatGPT-C and EB (all Ps<.001). However, the responses from all LLMs are
   relatively generalized, leading to lower accuracy and practicality for
   the expert questionnaire compared to the patient questionnaire.
   Additionally, there were issues such as the lack of supporting evidence
   and potential ethical risks in the responses of LLMs. Conclusions:
   Currently, compared to other LLMs, ChatGPT-E has demonstrated greater
   potential for application in educating Chinese patients with breast
   cancer, and may serve as an effective tool for them to obtain health
   information. However, for breast cancer specialists, these LLMs are not
   yet suitable for assisting in clinical diagnosis or treatment
   activities. Additionally, data security, ethical, and legal risks
   associated with using LLMs in clinical practice cannot be ignored. In
   the future, further research is needed to determine the true efficacy of
   LLMs in clinical scenarios related to breast cancer in China.

   completeness, and comprehensibility, respectively. The Flesch-Kincaid
   and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook scoring systems were employed as
   readability assessment tools. Results: Accuracy and comprehensibility
   were acceptable for English PEMs of all sources, while completence was
   not satisfactory. Physician-sourced PEM had the highest accuracy mean
   score of 5.60 and LLM-generated English PEMs ranged from 4.00 to 5.40.
   The completeness score was comparable between physician-sourced PEM and
   LLM-generated PEMs in English. Chinese PEMs from LLMs proned to have
   lower score in accuracy and completeness assessment than English PEMs.
   The mean score for completeness of five LLM-generated Chinese PEMs was
   1.82-2.70 in patients' perspective, which was higher than
   gastroenterologists' assessment. Comprehensibility was satisfactory for
   all PEMs. No PEM met the recommended sixth-grade reading level.
   Conclusion: LLMs have potential in assisting patient education. The
   accuracy and comprehensibility of LLM-generated PEMs were acceptable,
   but further optimization on improving completeness and accounting for a
   variety of linguistic contexts are essential for enhancing the
   feasibility.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Early detection of Oral Squamous Cell
   Carcinoma (OSCC) improves survival rates, but traditional diagnostic
   methods often produce inconsistent results. This study introduces the
   Oral Cancer Attention Network (OCANet), a U-Net-based architecture
   designed to enhance tumor segmentation in hematoxylin and eosin
   (H&E)-stained images. By integrating local and global attention
   mechanisms, OCANet captures complex cancerous patterns that existing
   deep-learning models may overlook. A Large Language Model (LLM) analyzes
   feature maps and Grad-CAM visualizations to improve interpretability,
   providing insights into the model's decision-making process.
   METHODS: OCANet incorporates the Channel and Spatial Attention Fusion
   (CSAF) module, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Atrous Spatial
   Pyramid Pooling (ASPP), and residual connections to refine feature
   extraction and segmentation. The model was evaluated on the Oral
   Cavity-Derived Cancer (OCDC) and Oral Cancer Annotated (ORCA) datasets
   and the DigestPath colon tumor dataset to assess generalizability.
   Performance was measured using accuracy, Dice Similarity Coefficient
   (DSC), and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), focusing on
   class-specific segmentation performance.
   RESULTS: OCANet outperformed state-of-the-art models across all
   datasets. On ORCA, it achieved 90.98% accuracy, 86.14% DSC, and 77.10%
   mIoU. On OCDC, it reached 98.24% accuracy, 94.09% DSC, and 88.84% mIoU.
   On DigestPath, it demonstrated strong generalization with 84.65% DSC
   despite limited training data. The model showed superior carcinoma
   detection performance, distinguishing cancerous from non-cancerous
   regions with high specificity.
   CONCLUSION: OCANet enhances tumor segmentation accuracy and
   interpretability in histopathological images by integrating advanced
   attention mechanisms. Combining visual and textual insights, its
   multimodal explainability framework improves transparency while
   supporting clinical decision-making. With strong generalization across
   datasets and computational efficiency, OCANet presents a promising tool
   for oral and other cancer diagnostics, particularly in resource-limited
   settings.

AB Gynecologic cancer requires personalized care to improve outcomes. Large
   language models (LLMs) hold the potential to provide intelligent
   question-answering with reliable information about medical queries in
   clear and plain English, which can be understood by both healthcare
   providers and patients. We aimed to evaluate two freely available LLMs
   (ChatGPT and Google's Bard) in answering questions regarding the
   management of gynecologic cancer. The LLMs' performances were evaluated
   by developing a set questions that addressed common gynecologic
   oncologic findings from a patient's perspective and more complex
   questions to elicit recommendations from a clinician's perspective. Each
   question was presented to the LLM interface, and the responses generated
   by the artificial intelligence (AI) model were recorded. The responses
   were assessed based on the adherence to the National Comprehensive
   Cancer Network and European Society of Gynecological Oncology
   guidelines. This evaluation aimed to determine the accuracy and
   appropriateness of the information provided by LLMs. We showed that the
   models provided largely appropriate responses to questions regarding
   common cervical cancer screening tests and BRCA-related questions. Less
   useful answers were received to complex and controversial gynecologic
   oncology cases, as assessed by reviewing the common guidelines. ChatGPT
   and Bard lacked knowledge of regional guideline variations, However, it
   provided practical and multifaceted advice to patients and caregivers
   regarding the next steps of management and follow up. We conclude that
   LLMs may have a role as an adjunct informational tool to improve
   outcomes.
   ChatGPT and Bard provide appropriate responses to patient's perspective
   gynecologic oncologic questions, but is less useful for complex
   questions compared with the National Comprehensive Cancer
   Network/European Society of Gynecological Oncology guidelines.

AB BackgroundTime trend analysis of cutaneous melanoma (CM) mortality in
   fair skin populations shows both a gradual decrease and/or an increase.
   To explain these differences, we analyzed long-term time trends in the
   incidence of the most common histological subtypes of CM: superficial
   spreading melanoma (SSM), lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM), and nodular
   melanoma (NM). MethodsUsing data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry
   and Statistics Netherlands, the number and rates of cases diagnosed with
   SSM, LLM, and NM from 1989 to 2016 were analyzed by age, calendar
   period, and birth cohort of people born in successive periods from 1925
   to 1973. ResultsPrimary CM was diagnosed in 52,000 men and 66,588 women
   in the study period. The annual age-standardized incidence rate
   increased three-fold from 14 to 42 per 100,000 person-years. The most
   common subtype was SSM (50%), followed by LMM (23%) and NM (14%).
   Age-specific subtype rates showed an upward trend over time for both men
   and women. Younger birth cohorts had higher rates of SSM and LMM
   diagnosis than older birth cohorts. This birth cohort pattern was not
   observed for NM. ConclusionsWe observed a strong increase in the
   melanoma epidemic curves in the light-skinned Dutch population over the
   last three decades. This increase is explained by younger generations
   having higher rates of SSM and LMM than older generations.

   potential for ChatGPT-3.5 and New Bing Chat acting as doctors using
   thyroid nodules as an example. Methods A total of 145 patients with
   thyroid nodules were included for generating questions. Each question
   was entered into chatbot of ChatGPT-3.5 and New Bing Chat five times and
   five responses were acquired respectively. These responses were compared
   with answers given by five junior doctors. Responses from five senior
   doctors were regarded as gold standard. Accuracy and reproducibility of
   responses from ChatGPT-3.5 and New Bing Chat were evaluated. Results The
   accuracy of ChatGPT-3.5 and New Bing Chat in answering Q2, Q3, Q5 were
   lower than that of junior doctors (all P < 0.05), while both LLMs were
   comparable to junior doctors when answering Q4 and Q6. In terms of "high
   reproducibility and accuracy", ChatGPT-3.5 outperformed New Bing Chat in
   Q1 and Q5 (P < 0.001 and P = 0.008, respectively), but showed no
   significant difference in Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q6 (P > 0.05 for all). New
   Bing Chat generated higher accuracy than ChatGPT-3.5 (72.41% vs 58.62%)
   (P = 0.003) in decision making of thyroid nodules, and both were less
   accurate than junior doctors (89.66%, P < 0.001 for both). Conclusions
   The exploration of ChatGPT-3.5 and New Bing Chat in the diagnosis and
   management of thyroid nodules illustrates that LLMs currently
   demonstrate the potential for medical applications, but do not yet reach
   the clinical decision-making capacity of doctors.

AB Objective: This study investigated the ability of Large Language Models
   (LLMs) to provide accurate and consistent answers by focusing on their
   performance in complex gynecologic cancer cases. Background: LLMs are
   advancing rapidly and require a thorough evaluation to ensure that they
   can be safely and effectively used in clinical decision-making. Such
   evaluations are essential for confirming LLM reliability and accuracy in
   supporting medical professionals in casework. Study design: We assessed
   three prominent LLMs-ChatGPT-4 (CG-4), Gemini Advanced (GemAdv), and
   Copilot-evaluating their accuracy, consistency, and overall performance.
   Fifteen clinical vignettes of varying difficulty and five open-ended
   questions based on real patient cases were used. The responses were
   coded, randomized, and evaluated blindly by six expert gynecologic
   oncologists using a 5-point Likert scale for relevance, clarity, depth,
   focus, and coherence. Results: GemAdv demonstrated superior accuracy
   (81.87 %) compared to both CG-4 (61.60 %) and Copilot (70.67 %) across
   all difficulty levels. GemAdv consistently provided correct answers more
   frequently (>60 % every day during the testing period). Although CG-4
   showed a slight advantage in adhering to the National Comprehensive
   Cancer Network (NCCN) treatment guidelines, GemAdv excelled in the depth
   and focus of the answers provided, which are crucial aspects of clinical
   decision-making. Conclusion: LLMs, especially GemAdv, show potential in
   supporting clinical practice by providing accurate, consistent, and
   relevant information for gynecologic cancer. However, further refinement
   is needed for more complex scenarios. This study highlights the promise
   of LLMs in gynecologic oncology, emphasizing the need for ongoing
   development and rigorous evaluation to maximize their clinical utility
   and reliability.

   Pulmonary cytology involves cell morphological characterisation in the
   specimen and reporting the corresponding findings, which are extremely
   burdensome tasks. In this study, we propose a technique to generate
   cytologic findings from for cytologic images to assist in the reporting
   of pulmonary cytology.MethodsFor this study, 801 patch images were
   retrieved using cytology specimens collected from 206 patients; the
   findings were assigned to each image as a dataset for generating
   cytologic findings. The proposed method consists of a vision model and
   dual text decoders. In the former, a convolutional neural network (CNN)
   is used to classify a given image as benign or malignant, and the
   features related to the image are extracted from the intermediate layer.
   Independent text decoders for benign and malignant cells are prepared
   for text generation, and the text decoder switches according to the CNN
   classification results. The text decoder is configured using a
   transformer that uses the features obtained from the CNN for generating
   findings.ResultsThe sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 96.4%,
   respectively, for automated benign and malignant case classification,
   and the saliency map indicated characteristic benign and malignant
   areas. The grammar and style of the generated texts were confirmed
   correct, achieving a BLEU-4 score of 0.828, reflecting high degree of
   agreement with the gold standard, outperforming existing LLM-based
   image-captioning methods and single-text-decoder ablation
   model.ConclusionExperimental results indicate that the proposed method
   is useful for pulmonary cytology classification and generation of
   cytologic findings.

AB Background: Cancer patient's outcome is written, in part, in the gene
   expression profile of the tumor. We previously identified a 62-probe
   sets signature (NB-hypo) to identify tissue hypoxia in neuroblastoma
   tumors and showed that NB-hypo stratified neuroblastoma patients in good
   and poor outcome [1]. It was important to develop a prognostic
   classifier to cluster patients into risk groups benefiting of defined
   therapeutic approaches. Novel classification and data discretization
   approaches can be instrumental for the generation of accurate predictors
   and robust tools for clinical decision support. We explored the
   application to gene expression data of Rulex, a novel software suite
   including the Attribute Driven Incremental Discretization technique for
   transforming continuous variables into simplified discrete ones and the
   Logic Learning Machine model for intelligible rule generation.
   Results: We applied Rulex components to the problem of predicting the
   outcome of neuroblastoma patients on the bases of 62 probe sets NB-hypo
   gene expression signature. The resulting classifier consisted in 9 rules
   utilizing mainly two conditions of the relative expression of 11 probe
   sets. These rules were very effective predictors, as shown in an
   independent validation set, demonstrating the validity of the LLM
   algorithm applied to microarray data and patients' classification. The
   LLM performed as efficiently as Prediction Analysis of Microarray and
   Support Vector Machine, and outperformed other learning algorithms such
   as C4.5. Rulex carried out a feature selection by selecting a new
   signature (NB-hypo-II) of 11 probe sets that turned out to be the most
   relevant in predicting outcome among the 62 of the NB-hypo signature.
   Rules are easily interpretable as they involve only few conditions.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate that the application of a weighted
   classification associated with the rules improves the classification of
   poorly represented classes.
   Conclusions: Our findings provided evidence that the application of
   Rulex to the expression values of NB-hypo signature created a set of
   accurate, high quality, consistent and interpretable rules for the
   prediction of neuroblastoma patients' outcome. We identified the Rulex
   weighted classification as a flexible tool that can support clinical
   decisions. For these reasons, we consider Rulex to be a useful tool for
   cancer classification from microarray gene expression data.

AB PURPOSESurgical pathology reports are critical for cancer diagnosis and
   management. To accurately extract information about tumor
   characteristics from pathology reports in near real time, we explore the
   impact of using domain-specific transformer models that understand
   cancer pathology reports.METHODSWe built a pathology transformer model,
   Path-BigBird, by using 2.7 million pathology reports from six SEER
   cancer registries. We then compare different variations of Path-BigBird
   with two less computationally intensive methods: Hierarchical
   Self-Attention Network (HiSAN) classification model and an off-the-shelf
   clinical transformer model (Clinical BigBird). We use five pathology
   information extraction tasks for evaluation: site, subsite, laterality,
   histology, and behavior. Model performance is evaluated by using macro
   and micro F1 scores.RESULTSWe found that Path-BigBird and Clinical
   BigBird outperformed the HiSAN in all tasks. Clinical BigBird performed
   better on the site and laterality tasks. Versions of the Path-BigBird
   model performed best on the two most difficult tasks: subsite (micro F1
   score of 72.53, macro F1 score of 35.76) and histology (micro F1 score
   of 80.96, macro F1 score of 37.94). The largest performance gains over
   the HiSAN model were for histology, for which a Path-BigBird model
   increased the micro F1 score by 1.44 points and the macro F1 score by
   3.55 points. Overall, the results suggest that a Path-BigBird model with
   a vocabulary derived from well-curated and deidentified data is the
   best-performing model.CONCLUSIONThe Path-BigBird pathology transformer
   model improves automated information extraction from pathology reports.
   Although Path-BigBird outperforms Clinical BigBird and HiSAN, these less
   computationally expensive models still have utility when resources are
   constrained.
   Exploring advancements in cancer pathology research: Path-BigBird, a
   specialized transformer model, shows promise in extracting crucial tumor
   information from SEER cancer registry reports. Outperforming HiSAN and
   Clinical BigBird, it offers improved insights. A step toward enhanced
   pathology report analysis. #PathologyResearch #SEER #Transformers #LLM

AB Background and objectives: With the development of deep learning
   techniques, the computer-assisted pathology diagnosis plays a crucial
   role in clinical diagnosis. An important task within this field is
   report generation, which provides doctors with text descriptions of
   whole slide images (WSIs). Report generation from WSIs presents
   significant challenges due to the structural complexity and pathological
   diversity of tissues, as well as the large size and high information
   density of WSIs. The objective of this study is to design histopathology
   report generation method that can efficiently generate reports from WSIs
   and is suitable for clinical practice. Methods: In this paper, we
   propose a novel approach for generating pathology reports from WSIs,
   leveraging knowledge retrieval and multi-level regional feature
   selection. To deal with the uneven distribution pathological information
   in WSIs, we introduce a multi-level regional feature encoding network
   and a feature selection module that extracts multi-level region
   representations and filters out region features irrelevant the
   diagnosis, enabling more efficient report generation. Moreover, we
   design a knowledge retrieval module improve the report generation
   performance that can leverage the diagnostic information from historical
   cases. Additionally, we propose an out-of-domain application mode based
   on large language model (LLM). The use of LLM enhances the scalability
   of the generation model and improves its adaptability to data from
   different sources. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on a public
   datasets and one in-house dataset. On the public GastricADC (991 WSIs),
   our method outperforms state-of-the-art text generation methods and
   achieved 0.568 and 0.345 on metric Rouge-L and Bleu-4, respectively. On
   the in-house Gastric-3300 (3309 WSIs), our method achieved significantly
   better performance with Rouge-L of 0.690, which surpassed the
   second-best state-of-the-art method Wcap 6.3%. Conclusions: We present
   an advanced method for pathology report generation from WSIs, addressing
   the key challenges associated with the large size and complex
   pathological structures of these images. In particular, the multi-level
   regional feature selection module effectively captures diagnostically
   significant regions of varying sizes. The knowledge retrieval-based
   decoder leverages historical diagnostic data to enhance report accuracy.
   Our method not only improves the informativeness and relevance of the
   generated pathology reports but also outperforms the state-of-the-art
   techniques.

AB Background: Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric solid tumor.
   About fifty percent of high risk patients die despite treatment making
   the exploration of new and more effective strategies for improving
   stratification mandatory. Hypoxia is a condition of low oxygen tension
   occurring in poorly vascularized areas of the tumor associated with poor
   prognosis. We had previously defined a robust gene expression signature
   measuring the hypoxic component of neuroblastoma tumors (NB-hypo) which
   is a molecular risk factor. We wanted to develop a prognostic classifier
   of neuroblastoma patients' outcome blending existing knowledge on
   clinical and molecular risk factors with the prognostic NB-hypo
   signature. Furthermore, we were interested in classifiers outputting
   explicit rules that could be easily translated into the clinical
   setting.
   Results: Shadow Clustering (SC) technique, which leads to final models
   called Logic Learning Machine (LLM), exhibits a good accuracy and
   promises to fulfill the aims of the work. We utilized this algorithm to
   classify NB-patients on the bases of the following risk factors: Age at
   diagnosis, INSS stage, MYCN amplification and NB-hypo. The algorithm
   generated explicit classification rules in good agreement with existing
   clinical knowledge. Through an iterative procedure we identified and
   removed from the dataset those examples which caused instability in the
   rules. This workflow generated a stable classifier very accurate in
   predicting good and poor outcome patients. The good performance of the
   classifier was validated in an independent dataset. NB-hypo was an
   important component of the rules with a strength similar to that of
   tumor staging.
   Conclusions: The novelty of our work is to identify stability, explicit
   rules and blending of molecular and clinical risk factors as the key
   features to generate classification rules for NB patients to be conveyed
   to the clinic and to be used to design new therapies. We derived,
   through LLM, a set of four stable rules identifying a new class of poor
   outcome patients that could benefit from new therapies potentially
   targeting tumor hypoxia or its consequences.

AB Unlabelled: The increasing demand for population-wide genomic screening
   and the limited availability of genetic counseling resources have
   created a pressing need for innovative service delivery models. Chatbots
   powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in genomic
   services, particularly in pretest counseling, but their application in
   returning positive population-wide genomic screening results remains
   underexplored. Leveraging advanced LLMs like GPT-4 offers an opportunity
   to address this gap by delivering accurate, contextual, and
   user-centered communication to individuals receiving positive genetic
   test results. This project aimed to design, implement, and evaluate a
   chatbot integrated with GPT-4, tailored to support the return of
   positive genomic screening results in the context of South Carolina's In
   Our DNA SC program. This initiative offers free genetic screening to
   100,000 individuals, with over 33,000 results returned and numerous
   positive findings for conditions such as Lynch syndrome, hereditary
   breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, and familial hypercholesterolemia. A
   3-step prompt engineering process using retrieval-augmented generation
   and few-shot techniques was used to create the chatbot. Training
   materials included patient frequently asked questions, genetic
   counseling scripts, and patient-derived queries. The chatbot underwent
   iterative refinement based on 13 training questions, while performance
   was evaluated through expert ratings on responses to 2 hypothetical
   patient scenarios. The 2 scenarios were intended to represent common but
   distinct patient profiles in terms of gender, race, ethnicity, age, and
   background knowledge. Domain experts rated the chatbot using a 5-point
   Likert scale across 8 predefined criteria: tone, clarity, program
   accuracy, domain accuracy, robustness, efficiency, boundaries, and
   usability. The chatbot achieved an average score of 3.86 (SD 0.89)
   across all evaluation metrics. The highest-rated criteria were tone
   (mean 4.25, SD 0.71) and usability (mean 4.25, SD 0.58), reflecting the
   chatbot's ability to communicate effectively and provide a seamless user
   experience. Boundary management (mean 4.0, SD 0.76) and efficiency (mean
   3.88, SD 1.08) also scored well, while clarity and robustness received
   ratings of 3.81 (SD 1.05) and 3.81 (SD 0.66), respectively. Domain
   accuracy was rated 3.63 (SD 0.96), indicating satisfactory performance
   in delivering genetic information, whereas program accuracy received the
   lowest score of 3.25 (SD 1.39), highlighting the need for improvements
   in delivering program-specific details. This project demonstrates the
   feasibility of using LLM-powered chatbots to support the return of
   positive genomic screening results. The chatbot effectively handled
   open-ended patient queries, maintained conversational boundaries, and
   delivered user-friendly responses. However, enhancements in
   program-specific accuracy are essential to maximize its utility. Future
   research will explore hybrid chatbot designs that combine the strengths
   of LLMs with rule-based components to improve scalability, accuracy, and
   accessibility in genomic service delivery. The findings underscore the
   potential of generative artificial intelligence tools to address
   resource limitations and improve the accessibility of genomic health
   care services.

AB Visual diagnosis is one of the key features of squamous cell carcinoma
   of the oral cavity (OSCC) and oropharynx (OPSCC), both subsets of head
   and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with a heterogeneous clinical
   appearance. Advancements in artificial intelligence led to Image
   recognition being introduced recently into large language models (LLMs)
   such as ChatGPT 4.0. This exploratory study, for the first time,
   evaluated the application of image recognition by ChatGPT to diagnose
   squamous cell carcinoma and leukoplakia based on clinical images, with
   images without any lesion as a control group. A total of 45 clinical
   images were analyzed, comprising 15 cases each of SCC, leukoplakia, and
   non-lesion images. ChatGPT 4.0 was tasked with providing the most likely
   diagnosis based on these images in scenario one. In scenario two the
   image and the clinical history were provided, whereas in scenario three
   only the clinical history was given. The results and the accuracy of the
   LLM were rated by two independent reviewers and the overall performance
   was evaluated using the modified Artificial Intelligence Performance
   Index (AIPI. In this study, ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated the ability to
   correctly identify leukoplakia cases using image recognition alone,
   while the ability to diagnose SCC was insufficient, but improved by
   including the clinical history in the prompt. Providing only the
   clinical history resulted in a misclassification of most leukoplakia and
   some SCC cases. Oral cavity lesions were more likely to be diagnosed
   correctly. In this exploratory study of 45 images of oral lesions,
   ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated a convincing performance for detecting SCC only
   when the clinical history was added, whereas Leukoplakia was detected
   solely by image recognition. ChatGPT is therefore currently insufficient
   for reliable OPSCC and OSCC diagnosis, but further technological
   advancements may pave the way for the use in the clinical setting.

AB Background: The rapid advancements in natural language processing,
   particularly the development of large language models (LLMs), have
   opened new avenues for managing complex clinical text data. However, the
   inherent complexity and specificity of medical texts present significant
   challenges for the practical application of prompt engineering in
   diagnostic tasks.
   Objective: This paper explores LLMs with new prompt engineering
   technology to enhance model interpretability and improve the prediction
   performance of pulmonary disease based on a traditional deep learning
   model.
   Methods: A retrospective dataset including 2965 chest CT radiology
   reports was constructed. The reports were from 4 cohorts, namely,
   healthy individuals and patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, lung
   cancer, and pneumonia. Then, a novel prompt engineering strategy that
   integrates feature summarization (F-Sum), chain of thought (CoT)
   reasoning, and a hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework
   was proposed. A feature summarization approach, leveraging term
   frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and K-means clustering,
   was used to extract and distill key radiological findings related to 3
   diseases. Simultaneously, the hybrid RAG framework combined dense and
   sparse vector representations to enhance LLMs' comprehension of
   disease-related text. In total, 3 state-of-the-art LLMs, GLM-4-Plus,
   GLM-4-air (Zhipu AI), and GPT-4o (OpenAI), were integrated with the
   prompt strategy to evaluate the efficiency in recognizing pneumonia,
   tuberculosis, and lung cancer. The traditional deep learning model, BERT
   (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), was also
   compared to assess the superiority of LLMs. Finally, the proposed method
   was tested on an external validation dataset consisted of 343 chest
   computed tomography (CT) report from another hospital.
   Results: Compared with BERT-based prediction model and various other
   prompt engineering techniques, our method with GLM-4-Plus achieved the
   best performance on test dataset, attaining an F1-score of 0.89 and
   accuracy of 0.89. On the external validation dataset, F1-score (0.86)
   and accuracy (0.92) of the proposed method with GPT-4o were the highest.
   Compared to the popular strategy with manually selected typical samples
   (few-shot) and CoT designed by doctors (F1-score=0.83 and
   accuracy=0.83), the proposed method that summarized disease
   characteristics (F-Sum) based on LLM and automatically generated CoT
   performed better (F1-score=0.89 and accuracy=0.90). Although the
   BERT-based model got similar results on the test dataset (F1-score=0.85
   and accuracy=0.88), its predictive performance significantly decreased
   on the external validation set (F1-score=0.48 and accuracy=0.78).
   Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to
   revolutionize pulmonary disease prediction, particularly in
   resource-constrained settings, by surpassing traditional models in both
   accuracy and flexibility. The proposed prompt engineering strategy not
   only improves predictive performance but also enhances the adaptability
   of LLMs in complex medical contexts, offering a promising tool for
   advancing disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

AB Objective: The reading level of health educational materials
   significantly influences the understandability and accessibility of the
   information, particularly for minoritized populations. Many patient
   educational resources surpass widely accepted standards for reading
   level and complexity. There is a critical need for high-performing text
   simplification models for health information to enhance dissemination
   and literacy. This need is particularly acute in cancer education, where
   effective prevention and screening education can substantially reduce
   morbidity and mortality. Methods: We introduce Simplified Digestive
   Cancer (SimpleDC), a parallel corpus of cancer education materials
   tailored for health text simplification research, comprising educational
   content from the American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention, and National Cancer Institute. The corpus includes 31
   web pages with the corresponding manually simplified versions. It
   consists of 1183 annotated sentence pairs (361 train, 294 development,
   and 528 test). Utilizing SimpleDC and the existing Med-EASi corpus, we
   explore Large Language Model (LLM)-based simplification methods,
   including fine-tuning, reinforcement learning (RL), reinforcement
   learning with human feedback (RLHF), domain adaptation, and prompt-based
   approaches. Our experimentation encompasses Llama 2, Llama 3, and GPT-4.
   We introduce a novel RLHF reward function featuring a lightweight model
   adept at distinguishing between original and simplified texts when
   enables training on unlabeled data. Results: Fine-tuned Llama models
   demonstrated high performance across various metrics. Our RLHF reward
   function outperformed existing RL text simplification reward functions.
   The results underscore that RL/RLHF can achieve performance comparable
   to fine-tuning and improve the performance of fine-tuned models.
   Additionally, these methods effectively adapt out-of-domain text
   simplification models to a target domain. The best-performing
   RL-enhanced Llama models outperformed GPT-4 in both automatic metrics
   and manual evaluation by subject matter experts. Conclusion: The newly
   developed SimpleDC corpus will serve as a valuable asset to the research
   community, particularly in patient education simplification. The RL/RLHF
   methodologies presented herein enable effective training of
   simplification models on unlabeled text and the utilization of
   out-of-domain simplification corpora.

AB The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) is pivotal in
   the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer through MRI
   imaging. Current deep learning-based PI-RADS scoring methods often lack
   the incorporation of common PI-RADS clinical guideline (PICG) utilized
   by radiologists, potentially compromising scoring accuracy. This paper
   introduces a novel approach that adapts a multi-modal large language
   model (MLLM) to incorporate PICG into PI-RADS scoring model without
   additional annotations and network parameters. We present a designed
   two-stage fine-tuning process aiming at adapting a MLLM originally
   trained on natural images to the MRI images while effectively
   integrating the PICG. Specifically, in the first stage, we develop a
   domain adapter layer tailored for processing 3D MRI inputs and instruct
   the MLLM to differentiate MRI sequences. In the second stage, we
   translate PICG for guiding instructions from the model to generate
   PICG-guided image features. Through such a feature distillation step, we
   align the scoring network's features with the PICG-guided image
   features, which enables the model to effectively incorporate the PICG
   information. We develop our model on a public dataset and evaluate it on
   an in-house dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
   effectively improves the performance of current scoring networks. Code

AB Background Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a type of
   large language model (LLM) developed by OpenAI, known for its extensive
   knowledge base and interactive capabilities. These attributes make it a
   valuable tool in the medical field, particularly for tasks such as
   answering medical questions, drafting clinical notes, and optimizing the
   generation of radiology reports. However, keeping accuracy in medical
   contexts is the biggest challenge to employing GPT-4 in a clinical
   setting. This study aims to investigate the accuracy of GPT-4, which can
   process both text and image inputs, in generating diagnoses from
   pathological images.Methods This study analyzed 44 histopathological
   images from 16 organs and 100 colorectal biopsy photomicrographs. The
   initial evaluation was conducted using the standard GPT-4 model in
   January 2024, with a subsequent re-evaluation performed in July 2024.
   The diagnostic accuracy of GPT-4 was assessed by comparing its outputs
   to a reference standard using statistical measures. Additionally, four
   pathologists independently reviewed the same images to compare their
   diagnoses with the model's outputs. Both scanned and photographed images
   were tested to evaluate GPT-4's generalization ability across different
   image types.Results GPT-4 achieved an overall accuracy of 0.64 in
   identifying tumor imaging and tissue origins. For colon polyp
   classification, accuracy varied from 0.57 to 0.75 in different subtypes.
   The model achieved 0.88 accuracy in distinguishing low-grade from
   high-grade dysplasia and 0.75 in distinguishing high-grade dysplasia
   from adenocarcinoma, with a high sensitivity in detecting
   adenocarcinoma. Consistency between initial and follow-up evaluations
   showed slight to moderate agreement, with Kappa values ranging from
   0.204 to 0.375.Conclusion GPT-4 demonstrates the ability to diagnose
   pathological images, showing improved performance over earlier versions.
   Its diagnostic accuracy in cancer is comparable to that of pathology
   residents. These findings suggest that GPT-4 holds promise as a
   supportive tool in pathology diagnostics, offering the potential to
   assist pathologists in routine diagnostic workflows.

   (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms, the
   landscape of data-driven medical applications has emerged as a promising
   avenue for designing robust and scalable diagnostic and prognostic
   models from medical data. This has gained a lot of attention from both
   academia and industry, leading to significant improvements in healthcare
   quality. However, the adoption of AI-driven medical applications still
   faces tough challenges, including meeting security, privacy, and
   Quality-of-Service (QoS) standards. Recent developments in federated
   learning (FL) have made it possible to train complex machine-learned
   models in a distributed manner and have become an active research
   domain, particularly processing the medical data at the edge of the
   network in a decentralized way to preserve privacy and address security
   concerns. To this end, in this article, we explore the present and
   future of FL technology in medical applications where data sharing is a
   significant challenge. We delve into the current research trends and
   their outcomes, unraveling the complexities of designing reliable and
   scalable FL models. This article outlines the fundamental statistical
   issues in FL, tackles device-related problems, addresses security
   challenges, and navigates the complexity of privacy concerns, all while
   highlighting its transformative potential in the medical field. Our
   study primarily focuses on medical applications of FL, particularly in
   the context of global cancer diagnosis. We highlight the potential of FL
   to enable computer-aided diagnosis tools that address this challenge
   with greater effectiveness than traditional data-driven methods. Recent
   literature has shown that FL models are robust and generalize well to
   new data, which is essential for medical applications. We hope that this
   comprehensive review will serve as a checkpoint for the field,

   there is currently a significant workload involved in transferring data
   under various aspects into slightly varying formats and applying
   interpretations such as the TNM classification of tumours. However,
   there is a lack of trials with real data to assess the applicability of
   LLM-supported processes in this area, which would enable an evaluation
   of efficiency and practicality. This study aims to implement and assess
   such a trial. Methodology A trial was conducted with N=153
   privacy-compliant and ethics committee-cleared medical reports from 25
   patients. Using the publicly available version of ChatGPT 4.0, an
   automated script was used to extract the date of initial diagnosis and
   common tumor classifications. The results were then individually checked
   for accuracy. Based on this, the utility of a simple system for guided
   support in tasks related to tumour documentation was assessed.
   Additionally, the approach was evaluated in terms of operational costs
   for the model and its applicability. Results In summary, the study
   concludes that the use of generative AI in this field is promising and
   suitable as a tool even in an untrained state. In a simplified
   calculation, costs of 35 cents are offset by a value creation of 61,54
   euros. However, it also becomes clear that AI can only act in a
   supportive role, and the correct integration with pre-made specific
   prompts and tools into the workflow is crucial for a relevant
   performance. Conclusion The use of generative AI in the context of
   search, transfer, and interpretation tasks in the creation of tumor
   documentation is a promising approach. However, its implementation in
   practical applications must be closely monitored, and the optimal
   interaction between man and machine should continue to be evaluated and
   must be accompanied by tools and task-specific prompts.

TI Assessing the response quality and readability of chatbots in
   cardiovascular health, oncology, and psoriasis: A comparative study

AB Background: Chatbots using the Large Language Model (LLM) generate human
   responses to questions from all categories. Due to staff shortages in
   healthcare systems, patients waiting for an appointment increasingly use
   chatbots to get information about their condition. Given the number of
   chatbots currently available, assessing the responses they generate is
   essential. Methods: Five chatbots with free access were selected
   (Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, PiAI, ChatGPT, ChatSpot) and blinded using
   letters (A, B, C, D, E). Each chatbot was asked questions about
   cardiology, oncology, and psoriasis. Responses were compared to
   guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology, American Academy of
   Dermatology and American Society of Clinical Oncology. All answers were
   assessed using readability scales (Flesch Reading Scale, Gunning Fog
   Scale Level, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Dale-Chall Score). Using a
   3point Likert scale, two independent medical professionals assessed the
   compliance of the responses with the guidelines. Results: A total of 45
   questions were asked of all chatbots. Chatbot C gave the shortest
   answers, 7.0 (6.0 - 8.0), and Chatbot A the longest 17.5 (13.0 - 24.5).
   The Flesch Reading Ease Scale ranged from 16.3 (12.2 - 21.9) (Chatbot D)
   to 39.8 (29.0 - 50.4) (Chatbot A). Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level ranged
   from 12.5 (10.6 - 14.6) (Chatbot A) to 15.9 (15.1 - 17.1) (Chatbot D).
   Gunning Fog Scale Level ranged from 15.77 (Chatbot A) to 19.73 (Chatbot
   D). Dale-Chall Score ranged from 10.3 (9.3 - 11.3) (Chatbot A) to 11.9
   (11.5 - 12.4) (Chatbot D). Conclusion: This study indicates that
   chatbots vary in length, quality, and readability. They answer each
   question in their own way, based on the data they have pulled from the
   web. Reliability of the responses generated by chatbots is high. This
   suggests that people who want information from a chatbot need to be
   careful and verify the answers they receive, particularly when they ask
   about medical and health aspects.

   files in 55% of cases (22 out of 40). ChatGPT options were agreed upon
   by 50%, 55%, and 57% of the three ocular oncology specialists. The
   investigation revealed significant differences between ChatGPT's
   responses and those of the three cancer specialists when compared to
   patients' files (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, and p = 0.001). ChatGPT's
   surgical responses matched with patient data in 18 out of 24 cases
   (75%), excluding enucleation cases.
   The decisions matched with the three ocular oncology specialists in
   17/24, 18/24, and 18/24 cases, reflecting agreements of 70%, 75%, and
   75%, respectively. The decisions made by ChatGPT were not significantly
   different from those of the three professionals in this cohort (p =
   0.50, p = 0.36, and p = 0.36 for ChatGPT compared to specialists 1, 2,
   and 3).ConclusionChatGPT exhibited a level of proficiency that was
   comparable to that of trained ocular oncology specialists. However, it
   exhibited its limitations when evaluating more complex scenarios, such
   as extrascleral extension or infiltration of the optic nerve, when a
   comprehensive evaluation of the patient is therefore necessary.
