# LLM Medical Research Analysis

## Description

This repository contains tools and analyses for investigating trends and research directions on Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain. The project focuses on systematic collection, processing, and analysis of scientific literature from sources such as arXiv,PubMed and WoS to identify emerging patterns in the application of LLMs in medicine, healthcare, and oncology.
